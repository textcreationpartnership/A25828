            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>THe Prophets, do they live for ever?</hi> as the holy Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> asks the <hi>Queſtion;</hi> wherein he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo implies the <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Surely they do not live for ever; which dayly experience doth bear witneſs unto; <hi>For we ſee that wiſe and good men dye, as well as the fooliſh and bruitiſh perſon:</hi> And 'tis no ſmall Mercy unto them (what ever it be to thoſe who remain) that
<pb facs="tcp:57453:3"/> they may reſt from their La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; yet were it not great pity that all their precious La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors ſhould dye and be buried in the duſt together with themſelves? Now although that gracious and ſweet-Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Man, M<hi rend="sup">r.</hi>. <hi>Timothy Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage,</hi> the late <hi>Paſtor</hi> to a <hi>Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> gathered in the City of <hi>Norwich,</hi> is now gone to his bleſſed Reſt, (of whoſe Death it cannot be ſaid, as 'twas of that King <hi>Jehoram;</hi> That <hi>he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted without being deſired;</hi> for his abſence is ſtill very much lamented (and not without cauſe) unto this day: Yet through the Lords good Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,
<pb facs="tcp:57453:3"/> ſome of his holy La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors that fell from him being taken up by the careful Hand of a Chriſtian Brother of that <hi>Congregation,</hi> who had the Pen of a ready Writer; are here preſented to the world (as ſome others alſo may, if the Lord pleaſe, in time be brought, to light) whereby ſuch as have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil, may eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perceive what a good Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure there was in the heart of that good man, whence ſuch good things, both new and old, have been brought forth. I doubt not but ſuch a ſweet ſavour of a gracious Spirit, will
<pb facs="tcp:57453:4"/> ſo evidently appear all along through the Veins of theſe <hi>Sermons,</hi> to ſuch as are <hi>ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual,</hi> and can ſavour ſpiritual things, as that ſhould I go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to write <hi>Letters</hi> of <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation</hi> of <hi>Him</hi> or <hi>Them,</hi> I ſuppoſe it might be ſaid to me as the <hi>Samaritans</hi> ſometime ſpake unto the <hi>Woman</hi> that perſwaded them to come and ſee <hi>the Chriſt; Now we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, not becauſe of thy ſaying, for we have heard him our ſelves, and know that this was a moſt choice and precious Man indeed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſeeing it hath been the Lot and Portion of the <hi>Saints,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:57453:4"/> even in all <hi>Ages,</hi> more or leſs to meet with manifold exerciſes, and ſharp ſufferings, in one kind or other; yea ſometimes even with <hi>Fiery Tryals:</hi> and what afflictions may alſo abide us in theſe latter Times, the Lord only knoweth: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I cannot but think, that the <hi>Subject</hi> of theſe enſuing <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons (viz)</hi> The <hi>walking of the Son of God with his Servants in the midſt of the Fire)</hi> may be very ſeaſonable and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all the Servants of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> even in theſe and the after times. What this our <hi>Dear</hi> and <hi>Reverend Brother</hi> ſpake herein, was (as it ſeems) that
<pb facs="tcp:57453:5"/> which he had the experience of not long before, having (as I am told) but newly come out of the <hi>Furnace;</hi> I mean a moſt violent hot burning <hi>Fever:</hi> ſo that there is the more cauſe to hope, that what came from his own heart, may (through the Bleſſing of <hi>Chriſt)</hi> go to the Hearts of others alſo.</p>
            <p>If any ſeeming Pleonaſms, or Redundances, or deficiency in any Phraſes or words may appear to any herein, let them pleaſe but to conſider, that theſe <hi>Sermons</hi> are put forth not by the Authors own <hi>Notes,</hi> which (as it ſeems) are very hardly to be read, but as they
<pb facs="tcp:57453:5"/> were taken from his Mouth in Preaching. I ſhall only crave leave to mention one paſſage, leſt poſſibly any might ſeem to ſtumble or be offended at it, <hi>viz.</hi> That about the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing of Errors, in <hi>pag.</hi> 118, 119. as if he did abſolutely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the exerciſe of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Power in any ſuch mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, or in any caſe whatſoever; Whereas if his Expreſſions be candidly taken, as they may, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Sword or Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Magiſtrate is not to be exerciſed againſt any Perſon meerly for the very holding of an Error, if no more, without any manner of Civil diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance
<pb facs="tcp:57453:6"/> or circumſtances of that Nature (for he ſpeaks not at all of any ſuch holding &amp; ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Errors) I know not any that wil, or can affirm or main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the contrary, and ſo take any juſt offence at the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. I ſhall add no more, but deſire that the Bleſſing of Chriſt may accompany theſe holy Labors.</p>

               <hi>I fee four men looſe walking in the midſt of the fire,</hi> ſay's the King; So that the fire was ſtill fire; it was not quenched; ſome conceive that the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel did quench the heat of the fire, with ſome ſweet dew, or by ſome freſh gale; but the Text ſaith, they were in the midſt of the fire: now here is the wonder; that it ſhould be <hi>fire,</hi> and <hi>yet not burn;</hi> the heat of the fire was not abſent from the fire at this time; for the fire did burn their bonds after they were in the midſt of the fire, after they were fallen down: So then it was fire, and when they were in the midſt of the fire it burnt their bonds, and they had no hurt; ſo that the burning faculty of the fire was not taken away, but only the art of it was ſuſpended for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, by the Mighty Power of God.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Here was another Miracle, that they <note place="margin">The Sixth Miracle.</note> ſhould be in the midſt of the fire, and have not the leaſt hurt, that the fire ſhould not reach to the hair of their head, or that the ſmell of the burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhould not be upon their clothes: <hi>I ſee them walking in the midſt of the fire, and they have no hurt:</hi> that fire that burnt the men that caſt them into the fire, did not them the leaſt hurt.</p>

Why he writes their names there, where he will not forget them: why ſee what the Lord ſays in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 49. <hi>verſ.</hi> 15, 16. <hi>Can a woman forget her ſucking child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the ſon of her wombe? they may forget<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> yet will I not forget thee;</hi> Verſ 16. <hi>Behold I have graven thee upon the Palmes of my hands:</hi> See what care God takes, that he might not forget his people; and ſo he would have us not to forget his Mercies: <hi>Behold I have engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven thee upon the palmes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>n you upon the plames of my hands;</hi> and doth the Lord thus take
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:57453:18"/> care to remember us: Let not us forget him.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we ſhould not look with a ſlight eye upon great Mercies: Oh view the Mercy, compaſs the Mercy, go round about it, tell the Towers, and ſee the Bulwarks, ſee what Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of goodneſs and mercie ſhine in them! Oh ſee how the Attributes of God do ſhine in them! God cannot indure that people ſhould deſpiſe affliction, his Chaſtiſements; <hi>My ſon deſpiſe not the chaſtening of the Lord,</hi> he cannot abide when men are careleſs, when they are ſleighty under affliction; and ſurely he will not endure that men ſhould look ſleightly upon mercies: <hi>My ſon de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not the goodneſs of the Lord, the mercies of the Lord, the deliverances of the Lord;</hi> Let not them be lookt upon with a ſleighty eye, look into the height of the Mercy, and the depth of the Mercy, and all the evil that would have befallen us, if we had not enjoyed the Mercy.</p>
            <p>And Thirdly, Take heed that we give nothing to creatures, but all to the free grace of God; this God he requires in thankfulneſs, when he gives ſuch Deliverances; aſcribe nothing to man, nothing to our ſelves, nothing to our prayers, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to our faith: No, give all to God, give all to free grace; look upon <hi>Ieb,</hi> take him for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, in the 9. of <hi>Iob</hi> v. 16. <hi>If I had call'd and the Lord had Anſwered, if he had given me my Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition;</hi> given me what I deſired, yet <hi>I would not ſay he hath harkened to my voice:</hi> I would not ſay 'tis for my prayers, or for my faith: No, I am poor duſt and aſhes, what's my voice in Heaven? No, ſure I will give all to him: I will ſay, ſurely the Lord hath heard his own voice, the voice of his
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:57453:19"/> free grace, pleading for me, he hath heard the voice of his Spirit pleading in me, and the voice of his Son, making Interceſſion for me: I will not ſay the Lord hath heard me; but that the Lord may teach his people this; he gives Mercies before they have thoughts to ſeek them: as in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 21. 3. Yea, ſometime God, he hath exceeded the faith of his people, to let them ſee that it was not for the worthineſs of their faith, though when God would give Mercies: Many times he ſets his people a praying and beleeving, but he doth not give mercies for theſe. And therefore God he doth prevent their faith; as you may ſee in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 126. <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>When the Lord turned again the Captivity of Sion, then were we like to them that dreamed;</hi> like to them that dream; as much as to ſay, When the Lord brought us back, we had not faith enough to believe it, we could not think that the Mercy was real; when as we came out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> we doubted whether we ſhould believe it or no, whether it was real or a dream: It was real, but it was not for their faith; and therefore aſcribe nothing to faith, nothing to means, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to prayer, but all to the free grace of God.</p>
            <p>Again Fourthly; we ſhould give back again to God, what God lends us: That is the Fourth way to expreſs Thankfulneſs: Hath God given us life; let us give it back again to him: Hath God given us ſtrength? we ſhould give it back again to God: we ſhould lay out all our ſtrength for God: Improve it for God, and be willing to ſuffer for God,</p>
            <p>Again Fiftly, in the fift place, We ſhould be willing
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:57453:19"/> to lay down our lives when God calls for them again: Thus ſhould we expreſs our thankfulneſs for life given us: I ſay, be willing to lay down life freely and voluntarily, the next time when God calls. When God hath reſcued any of our lives from the grave, why all thoſe days that are added, are freely given, and 'tis an addition of free grace, more then we thought of, more then was expected: And therefore we ſhould freely be wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to lay it down when God calls for it: we ſhould be willing to lay down our own lives and let them depart; and ſo friends ſhould be freely willing to let that life go, that was ſo freely redeemed: Thus we ſhould be Volunteers to death, we ſhould freely and willingly ſubmit to God, as well as dye in obedience, as in faith, and let it be our wiſdom, often to look to what Chriſt hath done for his people, in matter of death and the grave; and ſet faith on work every day; to ſee how the ſting is taken out by Chriſt; and the grave is made a ſweet reſting place: 'tis ſanctified, 'tis perfumed, 'tis ſanctified that it may be a ſweet reſting place to the Saints.</p>
            <p>Again, in the Sixt place, When God hath wonderfully ſaved our lives, we ſhould ſeek to do ſomething extraordinary for God; we ſhould not content our ſelves with ordinary ſervice, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>What do you more then others?</hi> in the 5. of <hi>Mat.</hi> and the latter end; if you onely love thoſe that love you, what do you more then others? or what ſingular thing do you? he would have his people do ſome ſingular thing for him: and eſpecially when God hath done ſome ſingular thing for them: and what ſays <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> when
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:57453:20"/> God had reſtored his life from the grave, in <hi>Iſa.</hi> 31. v. 19. <hi>The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee, as I do this day:</hi> The living, the living, he ſhall praiſe thee, he that hath life once given and he that hath life reſtored to him again; he that hath life given from the grave: <hi>The living the living, he ſhall praiſe thee: he ſhall ſpeak of thy glory<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and teſtifie o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> thy wonders:</hi> ſomething more then ordinary is implyed there; That the living, he ſhould live to God.</p>
            <p>Seventhly, In the laſt place to conclude, Look upon all outward Mercies, in reference to ſome ſpiritual Mercy, and never take up in the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Mercy, but let it lead you to the ſpiritual mercy: Alas what is life if it be not in reference to ſpiritual Mercies? if it be not in reference to get more of God, to get more glory to God: Life, what is it? a poor empty thing: 'tis true, life it ſelf is a mercy, a great Mercy; but yet though life be a bleſſing, a man may dye betimes and be bleſſed: <hi>Bleſſed are the dead that dye in the Lord:</hi> And on the contrary, though life be a bleſſing, a man may live long, and be a curſed creature <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>or all this: See what is ſaid in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 65 <hi>ch.</hi> 20. <hi>v.</hi> 'tis ſpoken of the days of the Goſpel: <hi>There ſhall be no more thence an Infant of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; For the child ſhall dye a hundred years old; but the ſinner being a hundred years old, ſhall be accurſed:</hi> 
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Tis a prophecy of Goſpel bleſſings; ſhewing how it ſhould be in the latter days: a child dye a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old: That is, the young men ſhall have abundance of the glory of God: thoſe that are children in years, ſhall be old in grace, they ſhall
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:57453:20"/> have as much grace as thoſe that were a hundred years old: and the ſinner a hundred years old ſhall be accurſed; a curſe, though he live a hundred years: See then, life is not deſireable, but in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to ſpiritual Mercies: Oh then reſt not in outward Mercies: if God at any time hath give<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> any of your lives; for a prey, reſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:57453:26"/> the ſouls of his people: he was content that his Son ſhould come out of his boſome, rather then he would looſe one of the ſouls of his people; the Son was infinitely dear to the Father, more dear to him then all the world; yea ten thouſand worlds, and yet he will part with his ſon, that he may reſcue the ſouls of his people from deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Oh how precious was the ſoul in the eye of Chriſt, what did he do? what did he ſuffer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deem the precious ſoul? how far did he come to fetch them? a mighty journey the Lord Chriſt took from Heaven to Earth, that he might bring back poor ſouls that were taken captive by the Divel, and reſcue them from death and deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; what great hazard did the Lord Chriſt run when he was upon Earth? Oh what mighty Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? what Troops did Jeſus Chriſt break through?

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:57453:29"/> Heaven and Eearth? Oh take not away the lives of my Servants; and God hath ſet Angels over them to keep their lives? and doſt thou account ſo meanly of thy life? wilt thou put away thy life for a trifle, for every croſs and diſcontentment that thou meeteſt with in this world? what diſhonour is this to God? and what undervaluing of that which God counts ſo highly of?</p>
            <p>But Secondly, Take heed that you act nothing againſt your lives take heed thou doſt not go about to ſhorten thine own life; take heed thou doſt not go about to cut off thine own life; this is a grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſin, and high provocation: there is nothing that the Devil ſeeks more then this, and this many times is a very urging temptation, a preſſing temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation: Oh take away thy life. Now I beſeech you remember how precious life is, what a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Jewel 'tis in the ſight of God; and will you caſt it away for nothing? will you caſt it away to gratifie the Devil at his requeſt?</p>
            <q>But Oh I live a mi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>erable life, ſay ſome, my life is a burden, nothing but croſſes, nothing but troubles in the world; it were a thouſand times better for me to dye then to live.</q>
            <p>I ſay, Should'ſt thou rid thy ſelf of thy affliction? or ſhouldſt thou not rather wait till God opon a door unto thee? what wilt thou break chains? wilt thou break Gods chains? wilt thou break pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be gon, before God hath ſet thee at liberty? Oh know God hath worſe chains: chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
            <p>But ſuppoſe thou liveſt in the greateſt affliction; why wilt thou ſin to rid thy ſelf of affliction? is not the leaſt ſin worſe then the greateſt evil? to
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:57453:30"/> ſin againſt God, an infinite God? and if the leaſt ſin be worſe then the greateſt evil, ſhouldſt thou ſin to rid thy ſelf of affliction?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object. Ay but, I live to ſin againſt God, that makes my life a burden to me; Oh I bear about me a body of death, and I drag it about with me every day ſo long as I live; it makes me weary of my life, and, I deſire to dye rather then to live:</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Well, ſuppoſe it; Suppoſe thou liveſt in ſin, and ſuppoſe by taking away thy life, thou doſt free thy ſelf from ſin: yet ſhould'ſt thou have an eye to the word of God; haſt thou any ſuch rule that God hath preſcribed to free thy ſelf this way? Oh, why doſt thou not look to Chriſt, and fetch it from his righteouſneſs, from his blood, and from his death? ſhould'ſt thou not go thither to be free from ſin? is there not pardoning mercy, and healing grace, and waſhing for all kind of ſpots to the utmoſt? thou talkeſt of freeing thy ſelf from ſin, and thou ſinneſt the greateſt ſin that thou canſt ſin, if thou takeſt away thy life. I tell thee, thou had'ſt better live a thouſand years and ſin all thy time againſt God, then ſin this ſin; and go about to do any thing ag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>inſt thy life; why this is the greateſt thou canſt do to God; thou giveſt God the lye: God holds forth grace and mercy in the Goſpel, and thou giveſt him the lye: he tells thee in his word, that he is able to ſave to the utmoſt, and thou giveſt him the lye: and therefore I beſeech you, remember your lives are precious Jewels, remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber what account God hath of them, and do not act any thing againſt them; do nothing againſt your lives.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, If you would improve life; then gain
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:57453:30"/> as much of God as poſſibly you can in the time of life, this is the way to gain by life; labour to gain the knowledge of God, and of his Son; labour to get inſight into the Myſteries of the Goſpel, the great Myſteries of Chriſt manifeſted in the fleſh: Oh there is an Infinite depth; 'tis worth the ſeeking after: Oh the p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ecious Mines of grace in the Goſpel; truly you cannot improve life better then this way; ſeek the knowledge of God and of his Son; ſeek communion with God, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance with him; get more grace from him more ſtrength; more ſpiritual good things, this is a rich improvement of a mans life; and will you not make the beſt improvement of ſuch a Jewel as life is? you will make the beſt improvements of your eſtates, put off any commodity for the beſt advantage, and will you not put off your lives for the beſt advantage? I tell you, 'tis a Stock, a precious Stock, that God hath given you to uſe: Oh why ſhould you let the Stock lye dead by you, and do nothing that may advantage your ſouls another day?</p>
            <p>Conſider again: this kind of improvement of life, makes a mans life more glorious; if a man be not thus exerciſed, and thus lay out life, to ſeek after God, and to get more acquaintance with him, get more communion with him, more fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowſhip of the Spirit, more knowledge of Chriſt, more grace, more aſſurance of his love; why it will make him ſcarce a man without this: Oh this makes a mans life, a noble life, an Evangelical life; when as he is exerciſed in ſuch glorious things as theſe; but when a man doth ſpend his life, and doth nothing this way, and does not give more
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:57453:31"/> of God and Chriſt, he lives like a beaſt; more then like a man: a poor low, carnal, ſenceleſs droſſie life, though he be never ſo high and excellent in the world, though he be in the greateſt outward ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, that man lives a low life, and he will not continue in his honour, but in the concluſion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> If you would prize your lives, labour to act as much as you can for God in the time of life: this is a prizing of life, an improving of life: know that life is given you for action; and when a man is dead, he doth not act for God: Oh therefore remember, that there is ſomething that God hath given every one of you to do in this tearm of life: thereis ſome ſervice, ſome work in your generation that God expects at your hand, even in this life: and I beſeech you take the <hi>wiſemans</hi> council that he gives you in the 9. of <hi>Eccl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſhall conclude all with one word of Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; doth God reſcue the lives of his ſervants in ſuch a wonderful manner? why, let his ſervants
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:57453:32"/> for ever truſt him: as great mercies do call for great thankfulnes, ſo they call for great <hi>faith</hi> in the Lord, expect a great deal of future confidence in him: when he hath declared his name to his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, when he hath once made his goodneſs and mercy, and power, and faithfulneſs, and truth to paſs by before them in ſome ſpecial providence, he expects then that they ſhould truſt him in the loweſt condition, in the faddeſt condition; that you ſhould take hold of him, and live upon him, he expects that you ſhould reaſon upon former experiences; and <hi>remember the years of the right hand of the moſt high:</hi> remember ſuch and ſuch yeers when the right hand of the moſt High was declared, when God wrought ſuch works of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance, ſuch and ſuch wonderful mercies: the Lord expects that ſuch kind of deliverances ſhould be ingagements to truſt in him; to truſt in him at all times. Many times we will not beleeve unleſs we ſee ſignes and wonders; and the Lord he is pleaſed to condeſcend to our weakneſs; and Chriſt he ſhews us a Miracle, yea he ſhews many wonderful works, mercies and deliverances that he works for his people: and now God he may wonder at the weakneſs of our faith, if after all theſe wonders we ſhall diſtruſt him: See what the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaith, in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 96. 10. <hi>Be ſtill, and know that I am God:</hi> why, in all your afflictions, in all your temptations, in all your croſſes: in all ſad conditions God would have you to be ſtill and know that he is God; and when ever we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any ſpecial mercy from God, we ſhould urge this upon our ow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now where God gives life, he takes care for life, he takes care for the comforts of life: See what proviſion God did make for the beaſts in the old Law; there was a Law given in the 25. of Deut. v. 4. <hi>That they ſhould not muzzle the mouth of the Ox that treadeth out the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Truſt God for the overcoming of all the evils of this life: 'Tis true, Gods people may meet with a great deal of evil in their way, there is many Tribulations to go through; Now

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, Nay believe further, you that are Gods people, Your lives ſhall not be taken away, till you have done that work that God hath ſent you into the world for: So that you need not fear untimely death: I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

That is the third particular.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Truſt God for ſpiritual mercies; even outward mercies ſhould ſtrengthen our confidence to truſt God for ſpiritual mercies; Truly Brethren, this is the beſt improvement that you can make of mercies and deliverances, when as you can ſee ſo much of God as ſhould draw forth your hearts for ever, in all conditions, to put your truſt in God; Now know, that the outward mercies were given for this end: It is one end I ſay, wherefore God gives mercie, that ſo he might ingage his people, for the future to truſt in him; it would be a great diſcredit to God, if his people after all experiences, he hath given them ſhall not truſt in him for the future, and there is nothing that doth provoke God more then this. If <hi>Iſrael</hi> after all the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences that God hath given them, after all the wonders they had ſeen in the Land of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and in the red Sea, and after all this ſhall diſtruſt God through unbelief, God does look upon it as a great provocation: See what God ſays in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 78. about the 19 20 verſes, 'tis ſaid in v. 18 <hi>That they tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, yea they ſpake againſt God,</hi> in the 19. verſ. <hi>They ſaid; can God furniſh a Table in the wilderneſs?</hi>

               <hi>behold he ſmote the Rock, and the water guſhed out, and the ſtreams overflowed, can he give bread alſo? can he provide fleſh for his people?</hi> Now 'tis ſaid in the next verſe, <hi>therefore was the anger of the Lord kindled againſt them,</hi> therefore was the anger of the Lord kindled, becauſe they had ſeen his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders at the red Sea, and his wonders at the Rock, yet they diſtruſted him; <hi>can God prepare a Table in the wilderneſs?</hi> this was a limiting of God, and this their unbelief, it coſt them dear: Therefore the Lord ſware in his wrath, that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay, Whether can any mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I anſwer they may; and I will ſhew you when; When mercies received, or deliverances <note place="margin">How mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies may be helps to the ſoul for the future.</note> are helps unto the ſoul, concerning his confidence and truſting in the Lord for the future.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, when the ſoul is careful to lay up the experiences of mercy; when a man is careful to remember the goodneſs of God, a man may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive a thouſand mercies, a thouſand deliverances, ſuch as he might make experience of, for his own benefit and for the help of others, and yet be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the beter: I ſay, if they be not carefully laid up, if they be not carefully treaſured up, a man looſeth all the ſweetneſs of them; for there are two things that God doth intend in every mercy. Firſt of all, There is preſent comfort and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that he preſently gives out, and then there is ſomething in the mercy to be laid up for the future; there is ſomething in every mercy that God would have his people lay up, ſomething that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:57453:38"/> will ſtand them in ſtead another day; now when a man does not remember the mercy that the Lord diſpenceth to him, though he may take ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in them, yet he looſeth the greater comfort of them, that which he ſhould lay hold on is the fruit of experience, or elſe all the mercy is loſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Mercies become helpful when as the ſoul can ſee the love of God in the preſent <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rcy; when the ſoul ſees the love of God in every preſent mercy, this puts life into the mercy; when the ſoul receives mercy, and doth not eye love in it, that mercy, it proves a dead mercy; or if there be any ſence it will not laſt long, becauſe there was not ſpecial love ſeen in it: Now when the ſoul can eye the love of God in the mercy, then is the heart af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with the mercy, and then is the ſence of the mercy moſt like to be continued: When a man can look at every mercy, as the off ſpring of love, he will be careful to nouriſh the ſence, the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of that mercy: one mercy that the ſoul can ſee love in, is more dear, more precious, then many mercies: See it in <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> he ſaw ſpecial love of God to him in that mercy, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 38. part v. 17. <hi>But thou haſt in love to my ſoul deliv<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thoſe fifteen yeers that God added to his life, was more then all his life before, becauſe he ſaw a ſpecial hand of God here, and he ſaw the love of God here; and therefore this was a long-lived mercy, it was remembred, it continued, it remained in <hi>Hezekiahs</hi> heart ſo long as <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come helpful to the ſoul for the future, when as the heart is fully convinced of the unchangeableneſs of the love of God to his people: When he is fully perſwaded of this truth, That where God loves he loves to the end, and where he begins in a way of mercy, he goes on in a way of mercy, he goes all a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ng in free grace, ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt, All the ways of the Lord are mercy and truth, unto his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</hi> When a ſoul is once convinced, this will help much to turn mercies into experiences; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Doctrine which doth teach falling away from grace, that a man may be beloved to day, and caſt off to morrow: 'Tis a moſt uncomfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Doctrine; and 'tis impoſſible then that a man ſhould make any experience at all of the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that he hath received: If God be changable in his love, if he caſt off his people that he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in his free grace; why then though a man hath never ſo much of God to day, and know ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo much, and have never ſo much of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God in the mercy, he can have no expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience; and therefore that which concerns the ſoul, it is to be grounded in the unchangeableneſs of Gods love to his people.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Again Fourthly, A man may make uſe of preſent mercies to be helpful for the future, if he be careful to keep faith in action, if he be careful to keep faith upon the wings: To act faith in every condition upon the free grace of God, and the mighty Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt; it is faith that puts a luſtre upon all mercies; and if faith be down, a man cannot ſee the goodneſs of God in any mercy that he hath received; if ſaith be
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:57453:39"/> dead then the ſenſe of the mercy is loſt, precious mercies, they become uſeleſs, they are as a treaſure locked up, that a man cannot come by to make uſe of a treaſure buried in the earth, that will do a man little good; and therefore it concerns the people of God to keep faith upon the wings; act faith and keep that freſh and lively; and then all mercies and all deliverances that you have received, they will be freſh in your eye; for faith puts a varniſh upon the mercy, and though they be old, yet faith will make them preſent as things new to come.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Mercies become helpful for the future. When the ſoul is careful to keep up his Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, when a man is careful to walk with God continually, to fix his eye upon God, and to follow God fully in every thing, to follow God whereſoever he leads him; ſo long as God and the mercy is kept together, there will be abundance of luſtre and beauty in every mercy; but when the ſoul is careleſs in maintaining his Communion with God, it looſeth then the ſenſe of all his goodneſs that formerly he taſted in every mercy, and they become uſeleſs; even grace it ſelf cannot comfort a man if God be not nigh, if God by his ſpirit do not ſhine upon it: and therefore mercies much leſs though they be never ſo great and precious mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies that a man hath received; yet they can afford no preſent comfort nor be a ſupport to him, nor incouragement to wait upon God for the future: but if ſo be God and the mercy be kept together, then mercies become uſeful, and an help to the ſoul to truſt in God for the future.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Mercies are helps for the future, when as the ſoul is inabled by the Spirit of prayer, to urge
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:57453:40"/> God with former mercies, and to lay them before the Lord as ingagements to help for the future; there is ſuch an improvement to be made of former mercies: When God doth pour a Spirit of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er upon his people; and then, and then only do mercies that are paſt become a help to the ſoul or the future: you ſhall ſee ſo the Saints have urged this with God, they have pleaded with God, and put him in mind of his former kindneſs; ſo you may ſee in the 51. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> about v. 9. <hi>Awake awake, put on ſtrength.

               <hi>Queſt</hi> But you will ſay further, how ſhould we look upon our mercies ſo as to make the beſt improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them to ſtrengthen our faith in the Lord, for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>I Anſwer briefly.</hi>

I ſay, look upon all mercies that you have received as fruits of that which God hath reſerved in glory for his people; and this will mightily help to ſtrengthen faith for the future.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Look upon them all, as ſtaies that God hath given, ſtaffs to hold in your hands for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; all mercies, all deliverances, all ſights of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>od all manifeſtations of his love, all experiences of his goodneſs: I ſay, look upon them as ſtaies and crutches that God hath given into your hand for the preſent, to lean upon while you are in this your Pilgrimage; do not build upon them, you cannot build upon the beſt of your experiences, do not lay them as the foundation, but only look upon them as helps in your way, and ſo uſe them as helps for the preſent that God gives you, that you may <note place="margin">Two things premiſed, and a Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion how to reſt upon former ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periences.</note> more cheerfully go on to his ſelf, and to his ſon to the reſt in him, where there is everlaſting peace. And therefore here will I premiſe two things, and give you a Caution how to reſt upon former expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences; and ſo I ſhall end the Point.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Know this, that it is poſſible that the ſoul may looſe the ſight of all his experiences, they may be all out of ſight; 'tis poſſible that a man may call them all in queſtion, the ſoul may be brought into ſuch a ſad condition, into ſuch a dark condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it may call in queſtion all that ever it
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:57453:41"/> hath ſeen of God, and thoſe very things that he did take as ſome ſpecial Tokens of love, all mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtations given forth of himſelf, all communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his preſence, of his grace; I ſay, all theſe they may be darkened out of ſight. Or,</p>
            <p>Secondly, Though they may be in ſight yet God doth many times bring his people into ſuch conditions as their former experiences cannot reach them; God may come ſtill with further and further tryals, and ſuch tryals, I ſay, that all a mans former experiences cannot reach them: his tryal and temptations may be above them all: And therefore here take theſe two Cautions when as you are thus to follow experiences, and to make uſe of experiences.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Take heed that you do not make your own experience the firſt ground of your truſt: Make not, I ſay, any experience that you have had the firſt ground of your truſt, or confidence; I ſaid before, experiences are good helps, good Crutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but they will make no foundation for the ſoul to build upon: They are not the firſt foundation that is to be laid: No, you muſt learn to truſt God when you ſee him not, you muſt truſt God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore your tryals; for that is the moſt bleſſed thing. See what our Saviour Chriſt ſays concerning <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas,</hi> in that 20. of Joh. 29. <hi>Jeſus ſaid to him Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, becauſe thou haſt ſeen thou haſt believed, but bleſſed are they that have not ſeen, and yet have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved.</hi> The heart is ſo backward to faith, that it is well if it be by any means at laſt brought off to beleeve; and therefore the Lord hath condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to reveal himſelf to his people by experiences; but yet our Saviour, he ſaith, it is more bleſſed to
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:57453:41"/> beleeve and not to ſee. <hi>Bleſſed are they that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eve and have not ſeen:</hi> This kind of faith is that which brings moſt glory to God; to beleeve a man before he try him, 'tis a great truſting of him and ſo 'tis an honour put upon him; now to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in God before the ſoul hath tryed him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he hath had experience, this is an honour, a great honour that is done to God; and this is the faith that wil hold out, this wil laſt; this kinde of faith it will uphold the ſoul in the greateſt ſtraits, in the loweſt condition, when ſenſe fails and when experiences are gone out of ſight, why then this kinde of Faith wil hold up the ſoul: when the ſoul can truſt the Lord though he had not tryed him, truſt him, though God had not given experience; truſt him firſt of all becauſe of his word, becauſe of the word of his grace, that is given forth to the ſoul, as a foundation to build upon, this is an honour Indeed to God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Be careful throughout all your <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Caution</hi> 2.</note> whole courſe of life, that you rely more upon the word of the Lord, then upon your experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; throughout the whole courſe of your life, you will find this more beneficial to rely upon the word of the Lord: and here I beſeech you to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that this life it is the life of Faith, it is the life of Faith, and not the life of ſenſe; in He<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the Saints ſhall live by ſence, they ſhall have no need of Faith, the life of Faith is not proper for them; but the life of Faith is proper to Gods people on earth, to beleeve and not ſee: <hi>Faith is the evidence of things n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>t ſeen;</hi> it is taken up with things not ſeen: I ſay, this life it ſhould be a life of Faith unto the Saints 'tis not a life of ſence:
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:57453:42"/> And conſider moreover if God do give any ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſence, or if he do give any experiences of his love, it is given for this end, that ſo he might help the Faith of his people, that he might help their Faith, and ſtrengthen their Faith, that ſo he might encourage them for the future to truſt in him; to truſt in him when they ſee him not, when all is dark and ſad, when God ſeems to be out of ſight; I ſay, God gives incouragements for this end, that ſo he might incourage them to beleeve; and therefore it is that oftentimes he trains up his people in this way; he will ſtrike the Crutches out of their hands, he will put them to it, they ſhall walk alone by Faith; that all the ſence of Gods dealings with them ſhall be out of ſight, they ſhall have nothing to rely upon; God will put them to it, to rely upon him alone, upon a naked word of promiſe, upon the word of grace, to rely upon him though they have nothing in the world to rely upon,</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider, though it be great mercy that the Lord is pleaſed to condeſcend ſo far to the Creature to give ſpiritual ſence, and many times experiences, by which he will ſeal up his word and his grace to them, yet it is a greater mercy that God hath given a word of promiſe to rely upon, that is the greateſt mercy in the world; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurer foundation of hope, and that which will ſtand a poor creature in ſtead when 'tis in the dark, when all the ſence will be in the dark, and experiences out of ſight; but then the word o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Lord wil endure for ever; and ſo then to have a word of grace to rely upon, a word of promiſe; this is the greateſt mercy that God can
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:57453:42"/> ſhew to poor Creatures: My Brethren, if it were not for this, it were not poſſible that the ſoul ſhould be at any certainty; though God had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven never ſo many experiences of his love, though the ſoul had ſeen, and though it had felt, and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of love, and though it had layen in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome of Jeſus Chriſt, and been refreſht with his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ove; yet if the Lord had not given a word of grace to rely upon, aword of promiſe to rely upon; It would be impoſſible but that <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s one of the greateſt diſcoveries that the Lord makes: ſhew the ſoul how vile it is in it ſelf: and therefore I ſay, the ſoul is ready to queſtion all: all that God hath done for it, though it hath ſeen God walk in a way of love to him; yet ſtill, Oh 'tis too good for me, too good for ſuch a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:57453:44"/> ſeen his goings; ſhould truſt him for the future, upon former experiences; when God ſpeaks once in a remarkable providence, he expects we ſhould hear twice, again and again; In every low condition we ſhould hear, <hi>That power belongs to God.</hi> Truſt him for the comforts of life, and truſt him for the preventing the evil of life; truſt him for the upholding of you in life, till his time be come, and your work be filled; only be not you negligent, make haſt in your work; work the works of God while the day laſts: but yet you may be confident the Lord he will not ſuffer the Candle to be blown out till your work be filled: <hi>The righteous ſhall come to his grave as a ſhock of Corn that commeth in, in his ſeaſon;</hi> I ſhewed how far we may make uſe of former mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies for the future to become great helps of Faith; when the ſoul is careful to lay up the remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of them, when the ſoul can eye the love of God, ſpecial love; when the ſoul is once convinced of that truth, of the unchangeableneſs of the love of God; when the ſoul keeps up the wing of Faith, and holds up its communion with God, can go and lay before God former mercies, and uſe them as Arguments to plead with God for the future; as Gods people have done; then do mercies become helpful for the future.</p>
            <p>But how far ſhould we truſt Experinces? Why look upon them as Earneſts of that which God doth intend to give, and look upon them as Crutches, as helps in the way; ſo though all the experiences of God may be out of fight, for God may bring his people into ſome condition that may be above Experience, Experience cannot
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:57453:45"/> reach them: And therefore do not make your own Experience the firſt ground of your truſt; but truſt firſt in the Lord, and the word of his grace truſt them more then all your experiences; the life of a Chriſtian, 'tis the life of Faith, and not of ſence; the life of ſence is in Heaven; but the life of Faith is moſt proper here. <hi>Bleſſed are they that beleeve, and have not ſeen:</hi> and if God do give Experience, and manifeſt his love and goodneſs to thee, it is for this end that he might ſtrengthen Faith; he will learn his children to go alone: and therefore God many times hath ſtruck the Crutches out of their hands, and all ſights of God ſhall be gone, and God will make them to truſt in his naked word: Great uſe may be made of Experience; but yet I ſay, lay the word of the Lord as your foundation, and truſt that, for that will hold in all conditions, in the greateſt darkneſs, when Experience may be out of ſight, and you can ſee nothing.</p>

            <p>Secondly, As we have inſtances to prove it, ſo we have the word of Chriſt to prove it, to make it evident that it is not in the greateſt Miracles of the world to convert a ſoul to God: See what our Saviour ſaith, in that 16. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the 31.

'Tis the word of <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Parable; <hi>he ſaid unto them, if you hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will you be perſwaded, though one roſe from the dead:</hi> The rich man in Hell, he deſires that one may be ſent from the dead to give them war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; why <hi>Abraham</hi> tells them they have <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets, let them hear them,</hi> and <hi>if they hear not Moſes &amp; the Prophets, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Point may be further cleered, by our own Experiences. I ſay, by experiences of our own days; are there not many poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that have ſeen Miracles of Mercy, that have ſeen God, many times in wonderful way of deliverance towards them? at ſuch a time they were in danger, eminent danger, at ſuch a time they were nigh to death, and what great promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and what great purpoſes came into their
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:57453:48"/> hearts and mouths: and yet notwithſtanding all that God hath done for them, they have turned again to folly; nay, ſometime they have ſeen and taſted as it were of the power of the world to come, that God hath convinced them many times of the excellency of the way, and the neceſſity of walking with him, and the happy condition of the Saints, &amp; they it may be, have had ſome taſts, ſome drops to cool their tongue; and though they have had that Miracle of Mercy, yet notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their hearts have gone back again; and they have not bin converted and perſwaded to come to Chriſt, after a hearty draught of his love and good neſs, which might abundantly ſatisfie them: others that have ſeen even Miracles of judgment; God many many times hath wrought ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction in their conſcience, they have been as it were for the preſent, hung over the flames of Hell, and great thoughts have been darted into their ſpirits; convincing thoughts of the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſeeking after faith, they have ſeen as it were the mighty conſequence of the ſoul, the mighty conſequence of the things of Eternity, and yet have worn out all hints that have been made upon conſcience, and ſoon returned to their former ways of folly; to folly &amp; deſperate madnes; others taken up in vanity, taken up in the world, others taken up in their own righteouſneſs, and think themſelves whole, and need no Phyſician; notwithſtanding all theſe Miracles of judgment; how many are there that have ſeen them, and have felt them, and have not been brought home ſavingly by them?</p>
            <p>But you will ſay, how come this to paſs! what
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:57453:49"/> cannot miracles of works bring home a ſoul to God? what then? what miracles?</p>
            <p>I anſwer firſt of all, God would have it ſo that he might put a great glory upon his word, he will <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>1</label> have it known what the word of the Lord is, he will make known the power and efficacy of it; his word is more dear to him then his work, more then all his works of Creation, of Providence, or Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; though all periſh, yet the word of the Lord that endures, that abides; God will put a great deal of glory upon his word; and therefore he hath choſen his word rather then Miracles; though men think, Oh Miracles are glorious; and ſurely, if God ſhew miracles that will convert, that will bring home the ſoul to God; but Gods thoughts are not our thoughts, his waies are not our waies, he knows that miracles cannot do it: therefore he hath choſen his word, he will make that glorious in the Converſion of ſinners; for the moſt part God works by his word; it is true, the word it ſelf neither cannot do it, the word with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Spirit is a dead letter; but God is pleaſed to ſend his ſpirit along with his word; when hee intends this work the ſpirit of the Lord ſhall come with ſome word from heaven that ſhall be effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al to turn the heart of a ſinner, when Miracles of judgment or mercy cannot do it; it ſeems a weak thing to men, but the word of the Lord is mighty and powerful: When God is intended to catch any ſoul to bring it home, commonly this is his Net, he takes his word, and throws that over them, and that ſhall catch them. When he is intended to beat down ſtrong holds, mighty Towers of luſts, ſinful imaginations that do exalt themſelves
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:57453:49"/> againſt Himſelf, and his Son, and his Goſpel; why, God is pleaſed to uſe his word as the battery which will do this great and glorious work.</p>
            <p>Secondly, It comes to paſs from the deſperate <label type="milestone">
                  <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſon </seg>2</label> hardneſs that is in mans heart; that averſneſs that is in the ſoul naturally to God: it is the hardeſt matter in the world to bring God and the ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: Oh what ſtriving is there in the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous heart, before it is brought to God? it flies off from God; and the ſoul is forced to put Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments upon himſelf, it may be again and again; <hi>Why, art thou caſt down Oh my ſoul, why art thou diſquieted? why, trust in God; Why truſt in God.</hi> He repeets it again, and again, and all too little to truſt in God, and to have confidence in God; but there is much more averſneſs in a natural mans heart to God; there is an infinite diſtance, there is a contrariety; and 'tis a hard matter to bring off a ſoul to cloſe with God, to ſubmit to him: the greateſt Miracle in the world cannot do it: why, when there is much peace in Gods heart, there is war in the ſinners heart; yea, when there is peace in Gods mouth too, there is war in the ſinners mouth: when God doth call upon them, come and behold the face of my Son, and behold the face of my righteouſnes, I give thee leave to look to either me, ſo thou look to me through my Son: yet ſtill he will have his heart draw back, and he wil look to God through his own righteouſneſs, that of a creature, or elſe run away from God, hide himſelf in his own ſhame and confuſion, and dare not come to God: And truly 'tis a very hard thing to overcome the heart in this cauſe, to truſt God, to rely upon him; the heart is fille'd with

I tell you, you muſt have a word, a ſure word, to go upon; for the ſoul dare not go to God, he looking up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf as ſtubble, and upon God as a conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming fire; and ſtill he keeps off from God: and therefore nothing but the word of the Lord can perſwade the heart to come in, and to truſt, and <note place="margin">Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Point.</note> rely upon God.</p>

                  </gap>now that I have loved thee:</hi> He makes this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to them, as a recompence to them for their faithfulneſs, becauſe they had kept cloſe to the word in time of perſecution; now as a recompence of their faithfulneſs and love, Chriſt makes this promiſe to them: Well, becauſe thou haſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:57453:57"/> all for me, becauſe thou haſt ventured thy name for me, thou haſt ſuffered reproach for me; I will give thee a name, thou ſhalt have a name in all places, where thou haſt been put to ſhame; thoſe enemies that hated thee, that made a ſcorn of thee; I will make them to come and fall down and worſhip thee; I will make them to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that God is with thee: this is a promiſe that Chriſt hath given out, and he will fulfil it to his Churches, thoſe that have kept the word of Chriſt; thoſe that are faithful to the truth of Chriſt, to the ways of Chriſt, in the worſt times, though they may ſuffer reproach for a time, yet at laſt he wil make the very enemies to confeſs that he was with them: That's the ſecond Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Therfore it is that God hath put ſo much power into his word, to convince the men of the <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Demonſt.</hi> 3.</note> world, and to force them to make them acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that the Lord is with his people, and that he hath loved them, and that he deals graciouſly with them; I ſay, for this end the Lord hath made his word powerful, he hath made it ſharper then a two edged ſword, that it ſhall ſerve not only for the converſion of ſome, but for the conviction of many that are not really brought home to God; The Goſpel where it comes, it ſhall lay chains up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on men, it ſhall lay a reſtraint upon men; See what is ſpoken of the power of the word of God, in the firſt Epiſtle of the <hi>Corinthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> and the 14. 24. 25. verſes. <hi>But if all Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, and there come in one that beleeveth not, or one unlearned, he is convinced of all, he is judged of all.</hi> Verſe 25. <hi>And thus are the ſecrets of his</hi>
               <pb n="97" facs="tcp:57453:57"/> 
               <hi>heart made manifeſt; and ſo falling down on his face, he will he will worſhip God, and report that God is in you of a truth.</hi> See the power that God hath put into his word for the convincing of the hearts of wicked men, that God is in his word, and that God is with his people; the ſecrets of his heart ſhall be made manifeſt, when he comes in, he ſhall fall down on his face, and ſay <hi>God is in you of a truth:</hi> It may be, before he came, he had hard thoughts of the people of God; it may be, he was ready to ſay, that folly was in them, and madneſs was in them; nay, they were ready to ſay, that the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil was in them: Ay but when his conſcience lay before the word; when he comes and ſees your way, when he hears that God ſpeak in you, ſuch a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſhall go along with the word, that it ſhall lay chains upon him; and it ſhall make him to fall down and ſay I was deceived, I was wrong in that I did judge amiſs of the people of God; Now I ſee that God is in you of a truth.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Therefore it is that when God hath dealt graciouſly with his people, when he hath given out great mercies; or great deliverances, he hath ordered it ſo, that their greateſt enemies ſhould be eye witneſſes, and ſometimes Agents againſt their will, in doing good to his ſervants; you ſhall finde it ſo, that when God hath ſo order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to do great things for his people, he hath made his peoples enemies to be great eye witneſſes, and ear witneſſes: You ſee here in the Text, how God doth order the King <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> that he ſhould be preſent to ſee this Miracle, that ſo a work of conviction ſhould paſs upon his conſcience; it is a wonder that the King ſhould be preſent, and

            <p>Firſt, The Lord he works <hi>freely</hi> for his people he works freely for his name ſake; when there is nothing at all in them, that might deſerve the leaſt mercy: God many times gives out great mercies when they can apprehend nothing in themſelves: Nay, when the men of the world of look upon them and ſee nothing in them; they themſelves through their grace and humility, ſee nothing in themſelves, and the men of the world ſee nothing in them; why God ſhould do them good; yet the Lord then ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times he gives out great mercies, and works great deliverances for his people.</p>

When a man looks upon an object that pleaſeth him, he thinks he never looks enough, he doth enlarge his ſenſe, to take in the ſpeciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the thing, and he thinks he never ſees enough; the ſame word is uſed by the Propet <hi>Iſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah,</hi> 53. verſe 11. <hi>He ſhall ſee the travel of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Firſt of all, Here is ground of patience, and incouragement to the Saints in all tribulations, in all adverſities, in the midſt of your greateſt afflictions, in the midſt of all the perſecution you meet with for Chriſts ſake, for his Goſpel ſake; for his truths ſake; though the world caſt ſhame upon you; tim<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Let it be an Item to the men of the world; Oh take heed how you look with delight upon the miſeries of the Saints, upon the afflictions of the Saints! I tell you, God will not bear with it, he will puniſh you for it: how did God threa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>Edom,</hi> becauſe he ſtood and looked upon his brother in the day of adverſity; he ſtood in the high-way gazeing upon his brothers miſery, and delighted in it: I tell you, you that laugh at the miſery of the Saints, God he will make you lament and they ſhall not only rejoyce, but they ſhall ſhout for joy; the time is a coming, that he will make you to ſee the mercy, and that he is with them, and deals graciouſly with them;</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Let Gods people acknowledge this as a great mercy, that God ſhould work conviction many times in the hearts of the wicked, that he ſhould deal in ſuch a way with them that might convince the hardeſt heart, that God is with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple;
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:57453:61"/> I tell you, 'tis a great mercy, 'tis no ordinary mercy; admire God in it, bleſs God for it, that God ſhould thus reprove men, and convince men for your ſakes: The <hi>Jews</hi> did look upon it as a great mercy, in the 126. <hi>Pſalm: When God turned again our Captivity our mouth was filled with laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and our tongue with ſinging; Then ſaid they among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them.</hi> They looked upon it as a great mercy that the Lord ſhould thus convince the Heathen; 'tis a mercy, for they writ it, they pen'd it as a great mercy, worth the ſinging, worth the glorifying of God for: that God ſhould work ſo powerfully upon the hearts of men, and make the Heathen ſay, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for them.</hi>

            <p>

            <p>Doth God make enemies confeſs that he hath done great things for his people? why then the people of God ſhould much more confeſs that the Lord hath done great things for them: if enemies ſay it, you may well ſay it, you have more cauſe to ſay it, that 126. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> verſe 2. <hi>They ſay among the Heathen, the Lord hath done great things for them;</hi> and what ſay the people of God? will not they ſay ſo? yes, in the very next words; <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad:</hi> ſhall the Heathen ſay it, and ſhall not we ſay it? yes, we are bound to ſay it, and to acknowledge, <hi>The Lord hath done great things for us, whereof we are glad:</hi> Remember, I beſeech you: remember, God cannot endure his mercies ſhould be ſlighted; he loves that you ſhould have great thoughts of him and of his mercies, that you ſhould ſay, <hi>he hath done great things:</hi> When God works deliverance

            <p>Therefore it is that God works in ſuch a glorious <hi>manner,</hi> as muſt needs convince; he works <hi>freely;</hi> He works <hi>ſuddenly,</hi> he works <hi>unexpectedly;</hi> and he works <hi>ſolitarily:</hi> Now Gods very manner of working de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance for his people, doth carry a great deal of conviction along with it: As,</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, wicked men they look upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions of the Saints; they ſay, <hi>Let our eye look upon Sion, and let her be defiled;</hi> Therefore doth the Lord make them to look with aſtoniſhment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their mercies and deliverances; God hath gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ends, even towards wicked men, he would convince them by this, he would lay blocks in their way, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I proceed to what remains: <hi>Loe I ſee four men, and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</hi>

            <p>There were three caſt in, and now there are four: Now before we come to conſider who this fourth man was; By way, take notice of the wonderful providence of God, that a fourth man ſhould be added to them; that while they were in the midſt

            <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay, God forbid any ſhould ſuppreſs truth, there is none goes about ſuch a work, but only to ſuppreſs error: and you will not ſay that that is perſecution; but that it is rather zeal for God.</hi>

            <p>My Brethren, To ſuppreſs error, 'tis a good work, 'tis a bleſſed work; but men muſt be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to do it in Gods way. Error in judgment

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rnal, but ſpiritual, and ſo they are mighty through God:</hi> Brethren, I am perſwaded it glads the Devil much, when he ſees men ſo violent againſt error, by drawing the ſword againſt them: I ſay, it glads the Devil to ſee men ſeek this way to ſuppreſs them, not that the Devil hates error, or that he loves the truth, for he hates the truth, and loves error; but he knows God will hardly bleſs that way of men, when men ſhall neglect Gods Inſtitution, and ſhall cleave to their own wayes, and to their own in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions; God will hardly bleſſe that way of men, when his own way is neglected.</p>
            <p>Beſides, Let men conſider, that 'tis poſſible,
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:57453:68"/> that while men go about to ſuppreſs error, they may ſuppreſs the truth for error; unleſs you will ſay any man hath an infallible ſpirit, or that any company of men hath an infallible ſpirit; if they have not an infallible ſpirit, then with what right can they force anothers judgment, anothers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience? men may, and do many times ſuppreſs truth, under the notion of error; we know in the times of Popery, that truth was perſecuted that we now ſee to be truth; out great t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uth, our main truth of juſtification by the free grace of God, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt without work, without merits: I ſay, how was this truth perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted? and how did men ſeek to perſecute this truth as error? many things have been perſecuted as error, which now we ſee to be truth; and why may it not be ſo now? does all truth come into the world at once? and may not we perſecute that which afterwards may appear to be a truth? Well let it be an Item to men, and let them not ſuppreſs the truth of Chriſt: it is a vain imagination, and men ſhall not be able to bring it to paſs, but the more it is ſuppreſt, the more it ſhall ſhine, and the more the people of God are oppoſed the more they ſhall multiply.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Here is a ground of Patience and ſtrong conſolation to the Saints in the midſt of all oppoſition and perſecution, that they meet with, and may meet with for the name, and truth, and way of Jeſus Chriſt: Hear what Chriſt ſaith to you; <hi>fear not little flock;</hi> you think you are but a ſmall number, there is but a few that profeſs the name of Chriſt; and Oh if perſecution ariſe it will leſſen the number: I tell you, fear not; that
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:57453:69"/> perſecution ſhall not leſſen the number, but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſhall increaſe the number: though the men of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>I ſhall make ſome entrance into the main Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine: Here you ſee three caſt into the fiery Furnace, and <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw four: Let us conſider then who this fourth man was: <hi>Nebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chadnezzar</hi> could not tell who it was; but he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſome glorious majeſty, and therefore though he was ignorant of Chriſt: Yet ſaith he, <hi>The fourth is like the Son of God:</hi> the form of the fourth <hi>is like the Son of God;</hi> that's ſure, he is more then a man; God hath ſent his Angel and delivered them, but this was in truth the Son of God. This Companion that is added to the Saints in Tribulation, it was Jeſus Chriſt, who did at this time create himſelf a body, and came down viſibly amongſt men, that ſo he might ſupport them, and comfort them, and deliver them, that it might hold forth this unto us, that he would come in his appointed time, to reſcue his poor people, that lay under wrath, from all the flames of his fathers indignation, and that he would be preſent with his people in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: when they went through fire and water, in the midſt of every Tribulation they ſhould enjoy him; ſo then here is another main Propoſition offers it ſelf; and I ſhall but bring you unto it, and leave the further proſecution of it:</p>

            <p>
               <hi>The Propoſition is this;</hi>

            <p>I ſay, Chriſt is never nigher to his people, then when they are in the greateſt affliction: they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in joy more of the preſence of Chriſt, then in ſad conditions.</p>
            <p>The <hi>three Children,</hi> they never ſaw Chriſt ſo viſibly as here they did, when as they lay in the flames; The children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they never ſaw ſo much of God among them, as when they were in the Wilderneſs, in the barren Wilderneſs, where there was neither meat nor drink, nor clothing, for they had a great deal of the ſpecial preſence of God, and abundance of the power and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and faithfulneſs of God, was manifeſted to them in a ſpecial manner, while they were in that condition: <hi>Jacob</hi> he never ſaw ſuch viſion of God as at that time when he was driven from his fathers Houſe, when he was forced to fly to ſave his life; he was in a ſad conditihn, he had not a bed to lye on, he had not a pillow to lay his head upon, but took a heap of ſtones to lay his head upon; and yet in that condition did God come and manifeſt himſelf moſt gloriouſly to him: he dreamed a Dream, and ſaw a Viſion of the Ladder ſet up to Heaven, and of the Angel Aſcending and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcending, God was there in a ſpecial manner; ſo he ſaith, <hi>The Lord was there, and he was not aware;</hi> never did he enjoy more of God, then in that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Stephen,</hi> the firſt Martyr, never enjoyed more of God, he never enjoyed more glorious Viſions
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:57453:70"/> of Jeſus Chriſt, then when he looked through a ſhowr of ſtones that came about his ears, and took away his life; he ſaw the arme of the Lord Jeſus ready to receive him, to embrace him in the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting armes of his love he had heard much of Chriſt in his everlaſting Goſpel; but he never ſaw him before with his eye. <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt, there is another inſtance, if you look into the firſt Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>John,</hi> about the 9. verſ. you ſhall ſee; there where he was, and in what condition he was in, when he received thoſe glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> If you ask me, But what preſence of Chriſt is it that the people of God do enjoy in their great afflictions, and in the midſt of their fiery tryals?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw</hi> 1. Firſt of all, they have moſt of the <hi>ſupporting preſence</hi> of Chriſt; never more of the
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:57453:70"/> 
               <hi>ſupporting preſence</hi> of Chriſt, then in ſad conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; he ſupports the inward man, and he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports the outward man; he upholds the ſpirits of his people in ſad conditions, and he makes their ſpirits able to bear their infirmity: Now here is a wonderful work of the Lord, that he ſhould ſtrengthen the ſpirit of a poor creature with ſuch mighty power, as to reſiſt, and to keep out the violence of ſuch mighty tryals, ſuch great afflictions: There is nothing that the Devil ſeeks more, then to drive affliction home to the ſpirit, that ſo he might cruſh the ſpirit and conquer the ſpirit, when he can get in, and ceaze upon the ſpirit, then he becomes maſter, and creats a deal of ſm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rt and vexation: Now the power of the Lord Jeſus is ſeen, in that he doth ſupport and ſtrengthen the ſpirits of his people; that when they have but a little ſtrength, no ſtrength, and yet are able to hold out, notwithſtanding they are ſo ſtrongly beſieged, and ſo ſtraitly girt many times round about with afflictions; yet he makes that little ſtrength to hold out at that time, that ſo he is pleaſed to renew their ſtrength, to give freſh ſupplies, and to remove the diſeaſe, and ſo the power of Chriſt is ſeen in ſupporting the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man; many times in the midſt of great afflictions: when the Saints meet with great afflictions; afflictions of the body, croſſes, ſuch afflictions as might even overwhelm the outward man, and they have but little ſtrength many times, yet the Lord doth ſo bleſſe that little ſtrength, that though they meet with croſſes, that little ſtrength ſhall not fail, till ſuch time as the Lord do bring deliverance to them.</p>
            <pb n="124" facs="tcp:57453:71"/>
            <p>Secondly, As they have the ſupporting preſence of Chriſt in the affliction, ſo they have the <hi>inlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening preſence</hi> of Chriſt; and that's a great mercy: commonly the Lord never teaches his people more then in affliction; when Chriſt gets them into the School of affliction then he inſtructs them, there he doth open mens ears, and he doth ſeal up mens inſtruction to them, when Chriſt draws nigh in affliction: I know afflictions in themſelves, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not teach, but when Chriſt draws nigh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they learn a great deal in affliction; they never ſee more of God, and of themſelves, never more of their cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, and vileneſs that is within them; never ſee more of the power and way of God, and the myſteries of Chriſt at that time, when Jeſus Chriſt draws nigh with his enlightening preſence:</p>
            <p>Thirdly; Jeſus Chriſt draws nigh with his <hi>ſanctifying preſence,</hi> his people have more of his ſanctifying preſence in their greateſt tryals, when Chriſt draws nigh to ſanctifie their afflictions, to ſubdue their corruptions, and to ſtrengthen their graces: the <hi>fruit of their affliction, ſhall be to purge them from ſin;</hi> afflictions themſelves cannot do it, afflictions themſelves harden; but when the Lord Jeſus Chriſt draws nigh in affliction, the Saints do enjoy abundance of the <hi>ſanctifying preſence:</hi> and through their afflictions they are made partakers of the Divine Nature; their corruptions are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and mortified.</p>
            <p>Again fourthly, They never injoy more of the <hi>quickening preſence</hi> of Chriſt, then in affliction: I ſay, the quickening preſence of Chriſt: many times dead hearts, how are they raiſed up, when
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:57453:71"/> Chriſt draws nigh to them? how are they eleva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted above themſelves and their own ſtrength, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are mightily acted by the Spirit of Chriſt? in the fifth of <hi>Hoſea,</hi> you may ſee there, how God doth promiſe his <hi>quickening preſence</hi> in the time of their affliction; <hi>Hoſea</hi> 5 laſt verſe, <hi>I will go and return to my place till they acknowledge their offence, and ſeek my face: in their afflictions they will ſeek me early:</hi> They were dead-hearted peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and they had loſt all activity for God, they were not carryed out with deſire after God, they would not ſtir up themſelves to take hold of him: Well, ſays God, I will make them prize me, I will fling them into affliction, and then in their affliction I will draw nigh to them with my <hi>quickening preſence; and in their afflictions, they will ſeek me early.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Again fiftly and laſtly, The Saints never injoy more of the <hi>comftoring preſence</hi> of Chriſt, then they do in the time of their great affliction: in the 2. of the <hi>Song</hi> of <hi>Solomon,</hi> verſ 6. what ſays the Spouſe there in her greateſt afflictions? <hi>His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace me,</hi> As Chriſt doth ſupport in affliction, ſo he doth embrace in affliction; he commonly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver revea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> into great tryals: he deals as an indulgent Mother with her child, never manifeſts more love then when the child is ſick; though a Parent does re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain love before; yet then ſhe mani<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſay, At the command of the Lord, the fierceſt of Creatures, ſhall not only not hurt them, but ſhall ſide with his people, to take their part, and do them good: The fire cannot hurt, nay the fire takes part with them, nay the fire ſets them at liberty.</p>

            <p>Secondly, The creature cannot hurt, but they muſt do good to Gods people, at his command; if the Lord will make choice of any creature to do his people good, he will effect his own deſign, it cannot be hindered, he will do them good by any thing he will do them good by any creature; by the moſt violent creature: Who would have thought that the fire ſhould have done theſe three children good? that the fire ſhould take their part? and yet the fire at the command of the Lord, does looſe their bonds, and ſets them at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty: Who would have thought that the waters at the red Sea ſhould have done the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> good? and yet they were abundantly uſeful to them in their paſſage through the red Sea; you ſhall read in the 14 of <hi>Exodus,</hi> verſ. 22. that the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> walked through the Sea, and the waters were a wall to them on the right hand, and on the left; the creature that might have been their deſtruction, became ſecurity to them; their way was made ſtrait to them, they could not go out of their way, for the Sea was a wall to them on the right hand, and on the left: Who would have thought that the Ravens ſhould have done <hi>Elia<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he works by <hi>improbable</hi> means, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by <hi>impoſſible</hi> means: I ſay, ſometimes God doth his people good by <hi>improbable means;</hi> to have Honey out of the Rock, and Oyl out of the Rock; you will ſay this is improbable, and yet this is his promiſe that is made to <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the 32. of <hi>Deuteronomy.</hi> verſ. 13. <hi>And he made him to ſuck Honey out of the Rock, and Oyl out of the flinty Rock:</hi> He ſpeaks of the fruitfulneſs of the Land of <hi>Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> God made the barren places fruitful, and he made the very Rocks to bring forth, yea the very flinty Rocks to be fruitful; the Rocks gave them Honey, and the Rocks gave them Oyl: That is, (as I conceive) God made the very Rocks to bring forth trees, and trees brought forth pleaſant fruit, the Rocks brought forth the Olive Trees and the Date Trees, and ſo they had Honey out of the Rock, and Oyl out of the Rock. You know that it was impoſſible that <hi>Iſrael</hi> being carryed into <hi>Babylon,</hi> they ſhould be carryed again into their

            <p>Yea God works ſometimes by <hi>Impoſſible means;</hi> you ſee it was impoſſible that the fire ſhould have been a protection to theſe three Children, to looſe their bands, and ſet them at liberty, and be a place to walk in; and yet it was at the command of the Lord. He can turn the very ſtones into bread; He can ſend bread out of Heaven, as to <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and give water out of the Rock, as to them in the Wilderneſs; He cannot only work without means, but by <hi>impoſſible</hi> means: And thus you ſee at the command of the Lord, all creatures muſt obey; He can do his people good by Improbable means, and by Impoſſible means;</p>
            <p>For the Grounds of the Point; Why creatures <note place="margin">The Grounds of the Point.</note> cannot hurt, but they muſt do good to the people of God?</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, Becauſe they muſt all go along with God; and where God is a friend, they muſt be a freind; where God will not hurt, they will not hurt, for they all go along with him: <hi>Balaam</hi> could not go againſt the word of the Lord: <hi>If Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lack would have given him his houſe full of Gold and</hi>

Yea, ſometime God doth give another word to them, he doth alter the Law that he made at their Creation; and he gives a new word of command, which is contrary to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and then alſo the creatures they obey that
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:57453:77"/> word of the Lord; See what God commanded in the ſecond Book of Kings. 20. 9. 10. verſes.</p>
            <p>Verſe 9 <hi>And Iſaiah ſaid, this ſigne ſhalt thou hav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of the Lord, that the Lord will do the thing that he hath ſpoken; ſhall the ſhadow go forward ten degrees, or go backward ten degrees?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 10. <hi>And Hezekiah anſwered, it is a light thing for the ſhadow to go down ten degrees; nay, but let the ſhadow return backward ten degrees.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Verſ. 11. <hi>And Iſaiah cryed unto the Lord; and he broughe the ſhadow tne degrees backward, by which it had gone down in the Dial of Ahaz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>See, God he can alter the Law of nature, and at his command, the Sun ſhall not only go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, but it ſhall go backward; if God ſay, Sun ſtand ſtill, it ſhall not move; and if God ſay, Sun go back, it goe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h back ten degrees: Thus you ſee that all the creatures, they obey the word of the Lord, they fulfill every command of God; if he ſay to the winde, winde ariſe, ariſe and blow, it preſently fulfills his word; if he ſend them about any work, and he ſay, go and carry deſtruction upon your wings, to ſuch a party, to ſuch an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, they preſently fulfill the word of the Lord; and then if he ſay, go and blow ſuch a man profit, carry bleſſings in your wings, the winde that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently fulfills the word of the Lord; they are all his creatures; therefore they muſt go along with the Lord; they are all his ſervants, and therefore they attend him; they are all the Army of the Lord; and all the Hoſt in Heaven and earth are his Army, and therefore they muſt obey the word of their General; they muſt obey his word of Command, they are all at his Command: And
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:57453:77"/> therefore I ſay, where God is a freind, the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures they muſt needs be freinds, they cannot do hurt, for they all go along with God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The creatures they cannot hurt, but they muſt do good to the people of God, for God hath made a Covenant with all the creatures for his people; There is a League made with all the creatures, even with the meaneſt of creatures; God hath not left one out of the League: See the 5. of <hi>Job,</hi> verſe 23. <hi>For thou ſhalt be in league with the ſtones in the field, and the beaſts of the field ſhall be at peace with thee.</hi> Now becauſe God hath made a league with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity, Fi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Object. <hi>But you will ſay, may not Creatures be hurtful to the Servants of God? May they not pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh by fire and water, and have their lives taken away by Creatures? Was not</hi> Stephens <hi>life taken away by ſtones? how then does God make a League with the ſton<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I Anſwer, 'Tis true they may, when God commands them to take away the life of his own people; but ſtill I ſay, they cannot do them
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:57453:78"/> hurt, they do but take away their lives, if they could ſend them to the torments of Hell, ſend them to the pit of deſtruction, that would hurt them indeed; but they cannot hurt them, though they be inſtruments to take away the lives of the Saints, yet they do them no hurt; for they do but ſend t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>em to their Fathers houſe, they help them the ſooner to God, to reſt in the Arms of Jeſus Chriſt, where they ſhall reſt for evermore.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Becauſe there is a League with the Creatures, they ſhal do them good When <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> entred into Covenant with <hi>Ahab,</hi> there was an ingaging to do all the good he could, <hi>my men are as thy men, my horſes as thy horſes,</hi> and all that's mine as thine: And ſo ſaith God to the Creatures, I have put ſo many particular good things, good qualities into your nature, that ſo you may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey them to my ſervants; and therefore I charge you be ſerviceable to them, give out all the good you can, let them enjoy all the good that I have given to you, for I made you for their ſakes: and therefore of neceſſity they muſt give out the good that God hath given them, they muſt do the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God all the good they can, becauſe God hath made a Covenant with the Creature: And this Covenant that God hath made with the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, is grounded upon the great Covenant, the everlaſting Covenant that he hath made with his people in Jeſus Chriſt, there comes in all the good that we receive by creatures; God hath made an everlaſting Covenant with his Son, in which he hath promiſed to be their God; to take them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Union and Communion with himſelf, to be their portion, and to give himſelf to them: And
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:57453:78"/> therefore becauſe God hath given himſelf to them, all creatures alſo are given to be uſeful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to them.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, The Third Ground of the Point, The Creatures muſt needs do good, they cannot hurt, but they muſt do good to the people of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of Gods watchful eye over them; the more hurtful and violent any creature is, the more doth the Lord ſet a watch over them, his providential eye is over his people; I ſay, the Lord doth watch over them with a ſpecial, providential eye: See what is ſaid in the Propheſie of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Vineyard; <hi>I the Lord will keep it, I will watch over it every moment, leaſt any hurt it: I will keep it night and day, leaſt any hurt it:</hi> I will keep it night and day: See then there is a ſpecial eye of providence over the Saints that are the Lords Vineyard; and therefore 'tis not poſſible the Creatures ſhould hurt it. God he watches over his Vineyard for this end, leaſt any hurt ſhould befall it; <hi>I will watch over it every moment;</hi> 'tis true other wicked men, they are kept from harm by a common providence of God, they have rheir lives preſerved; but ſtill 'tis but a common providence: But there is a ſpecial eye, and a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial providence of God over his people, leaſt any hurt ſhould befall them; there is no time, no moment, that God doth lay aſide his watchful eye, and not watch over his people; And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is no time that any harmful creature can ſtep in to his people to do them hurt; they all come under the providence of God, every crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture comes under the providence of God; and therefore the Lord he is able to prevent the harm.</p>
            <pb n="140" facs="tcp:57453:79"/>
            <p>Fourthly, The Creatures they are all given to Jeſus Chriſt, as he is King, as he is the great King: All power is given to him in Heaven and earth: Now Chriſt he hath reconciled the Creatures, and therefore the crea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ures cannot be hurtful to the Saints; the Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath reconciled the creature: <hi>He hath reconciled all things in Heaven and Earth,</hi> and made them all friends; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the creature ſhall not do harm to the people of God: See the Promiſe that is made to the Church, in a ſpecial manner it ſhall be fulfilled in the latter Ages; <hi>Hoſea</hi> 2. 18. <hi>And in that day will I make a Covenant for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

When they ſhall enjoy abundance of Jeſus Chriſt, when they ſhall ſhall enjoy abundance of Jeſus Chriſt, when they ſhall have abundance of the Spirit of Chriſt; why then ſhall thoſe promiſes be fulfilled in a great meaſure, they ſhall enjoy peace with the Creatures: <hi>In that day I will make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with them, in a ſpecial manner, with the beaſts of the field, and with the fouls of Heaven, and with the creeping things of the ground; and I will break the bow, and ſword; and there ſhall be no hurt in all my holy Mountain:</hi> we are all recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God by the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; And therefore they cannot hurt the Saints, but do them good.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Briefly to make Application, and ſo conclude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the fierceſt of Creatures you ſee cannot hurt; <note place="margin">Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</note> The fire it cannot hurt, but it muſt do good, when
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:57453:79"/> God commands; take notice then of the mighty power of the Lord: Oh know that he is a great King, and his name is dreadful over all the world; do but look upon the powerful command of God, what effect it hath upon the Creatures: 'Tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible they ſhould tranſgreſs, he hath ſet them bounds that they cannot paſs; they are all ready to obey his Command; if he ſay go, they go; and if he ſay come, they come; why this will make it evident. That God is a God of infinite power, to command ſo many Creatures, ſo many thouſand thouſand Creatures, as God doth order every day; and that God ſhould make them obedient to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry command of his, that none can tranſgreſs the leaſt command; but they muſt fulfill his word; when he ſets them about it; Oh this declares that God is a God of infinite power, and doth what he pleaſeth.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What a ſhame is it to the ſons of men that they will not ſubmit to the Lord? Will not the Creatures riſe up in judgment againſt men? When the Creatures fulfil the word of the Lord, and you diſobey the word of the Lord; ſhall God have more ſervice from ſenceleſs Creatures, then from the ſons of men, that was made Lord over them? Certainly this will be their iniquity ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther day, and the very creatures will condemn them: See what God ſays to that fire; fire, burn not: it cannot ſo much as touch the hair of the head: If God ſay to the fire, fire, burn their bands aſunder; ſet my children at liberty, the fire it burns their bands and fetters, and ſets them looſe, that they were able to walk in the midſt of the fire.</p>

            <p>And ſo all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth, and the Sea, they all keep their bounds; <hi>Hitherto ſhalt thou go, and no further;</hi> the Sea, a raging Element, it obeys the word of the Lord: The Lord ſays to the Sun, <hi>Sun run thy race,</hi> it obeys; <hi>ſtand ſtill,</hi> it ſtands ſtill, and is obedient: Now ſhall all Creatures in their places obey the word of the Lord, and ſhall not man? Oh what a ſhame is this to the ſons of men, that they ſhould diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey the word of the Lord? That God ſhould ſpeak but one word to the Creatures, and they ſhould obey, and that he ſhould ſpeak ſo many to the ſons of men, and they not obey: That God comes again, and again, and ſpeaks in his Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and ſtill man walks contrary to God: when he lays a command upon them; this is the command, That you beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt, and renounce all your own righteouſneſs, and rely upon the Righteouſneſs of the Son of God, and ſtill men diſobey: What a ſhame is it, for man to diſobey, and all the Creatures that the Lord hath given to him, to obey?</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Here is a great Incouragement, and ſtrong Motive, to thoſe that are ſtrangers to God, to come in and ſubmit to him: Oh that the Lord would perſwade your hearts to come in and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to him! So long as you are ſtrangers to God, ſee the danger you are in; you are liable to be harmed by all Creatures in Heaven and Earth; they are all at the command of the Lord; they all obey his word; If God ſay to the leaſt of Creatures go and take away the life of man; avenge my quarrel upon ſuch a Rebel, the Creatures obey: The Lord can arm the leaſt of his Creatures: a
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:57453:80"/> fly, he can make that take way the life of man; And therefore 'tis a miſerable condition, to be a ſtranger to God and Chriſt, to be out of Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant with God; you have no Covenant made for you and therefore you are left to harm of the Creatures every day: Oh that the Lord would perſwade you to come in, to caſt away your own righteouſneſs, and to ſubmit to the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of the Son of God, and to make a cloſe with him, and with his Son, and then all Creatures, will take his part: and if God be your freind, they will be your freind; and if God will not curſe, they will not curſe; and if God will not hurt you they will not hurt you; for they are all obedient to the command of their Maker.</p>
            <p>Again in the fourth place, To make haſte; This may let us ſee, that it is not in Creatures to do us good without: I ſay, 'tis not in the power of Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to us the leaſt good without God: We are apt to look too much upon Creatures; you ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect too much from Creatures, and too little from God; and therefore it is that oftentimes we are diſappointed: I tell you, they cannot do us the leaſt good, without the command of God; the very meat you eat, it cannot refreſh you, unleſs it have a command from God, and a bleſſing from God, and the very clothes that you wear, cannot warm you, unleſs they have a command from God; there is no creature can do you good unleſs it have a command from God, and a bleſſing f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="144" facs="tcp:57453:81"/> riches; and if they were in ſuch places of honour, and if they had ſo much wealth, and ſuch and ſuch a creature, ſuch and ſuch freinds and relations: ſuch meat to eat, and ſuch drink to drink; and ſuch clothing to put on; then they ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and their lives made comfortable; I tell you, my Brethren, 'tis a great miſtake; if you had thoſe very creatures you would have, ſtill they could not ſatisfie you, nor make your lives com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable: If God do not come along with the Creature, the Creature cannot ſatisfie you: God he can make your lives comfortable in the want of Creatures; 'tis as God will come in; and 'tis as God will bleſs: See what <hi>Job</hi> propounded to himſelf, in that 7. of <hi>Job,</hi> verſ. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="145" facs="tcp:57453:81"/> You know when God commanded the heaps of ſtones that <hi>Jacob</hi> layd his head upon, to give him comfortable ſleep, he ſlept well that night, he ſlept better upon his heap of ſtones, then he did upon his pillow, when God makes uſe of the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to comfort: and therefore do not think you have comfort from Creatures, as Creatures; 'tis God that muſt come in and bring comfort to you, for God can make every Creature comfortable; and the beſt of Creatures cannot comfort, if God do not come in.</p>

               </gap> afflicted conditions, becauſe he remembers his Ingagement, he is ingaged then to manifeſt moſt of himſelf.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all He is ingaged by his <hi>Promiſe</hi> and <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of it. it is ſpoken there of Chriſt; <hi>All my delight is in the Saints,</hi> ſaith Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>and theſe that are excellent upon Earth;</hi> All my delight is in them, next to the delight that Chriſt hath in his

            <p>Again Thirdly, He is ingaged by a Law of <hi>Friendſhip,</hi> to be moſt of all preſent with them in their low conditions; the Law of friendſhip binds him to it. Affliction is a Touch-ſtone, it diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers fained friends, and real friends; it ſhews whether a friend be Cordial or no: By the Law of Friendſhip, a man is bound to ſtick to a friend in the midſt of all his adverſity, and then there is moſt need of a friend: It was a reproof unto <hi>Huſhai,</hi> that <hi>Abſalom</hi> gave him in that ſecond of <hi>Samuel,</hi> 16. 17. <hi>Is this thy kindneſs to thy friend? why went you not along with your friend?

This ſhall never be ſaid of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that he broke the Law of friendſhip: It ſhall never be ſaid of Chriſt, is this thy kindneſs to thy friend? Why wenteſt thou not along with thy friend? Thov wenteſt not along with thy friend, but thou forſookeſt thy friend, when thy friend had moſt need of thee; no, the Law of Friendſhip is i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Chriſts heart, and he will keep it; and therefore he will ſtick cloſe, and moſt cloſe to his people, when they are in low conditions.</p>
            <p>Again Fourthly, There is a fourth ingagement. He is preſent with his people moſt of all in low
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:57453:89"/> conditions; in afflicted conditions, becauſe he is ingaged to <hi>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s work,</hi> 'tis the work of Chriſts own hand; he ſends afflictions for that end, to work ſomething in the heart of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple: and therefore he is ingaged to ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his labour and pains, that he may not looſe his coſt and labour: When a Phyſician gives a Purge to a P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>tient, he is ingaged to ſee what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of his Phyſick, how it works; So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the great Phyſician, he never gives any bitter Purge, any bitter Pill of affliction to his ſervants; but he looks upon himſelf as ingaged to look after it, that he may look after his Phyſick, and ſee how it works: the very preſence of Jeſus Chriſt will help the Phyſick, if it work too much, or too little; if the ſoul diſpiſe, the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtening of the Lord, or faint under the chaſtening of the Lord; the Lord Jeſus can by his preſence he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> If you ask me, how doth Chriſt give out much of himſelf in affliction? By what way or means doth Chriſt communicate much of himſelf in affliction: Briefly for anſwer:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Firſt of all, he doth raiſe up his peoples faith unto a high pitch; many times, I ſay, he rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth up their faith to a more then ordinary pitch, he clears the eye of faith, and ſtrengthens the eye of faith: Now the more the eye of faith is clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:57453:90"/> and ſtrengthened, the more it ſees of Jeſus Chriſt: Now the Lore he doth mightily ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en faith; many times in affliction faith is ſtrengthened, for faith is left alone many times, and then it works beſt; all props are taken away, God takes away all ſence, many times, and leaves faith to work alone; now faith never works bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then when 'tis alone; it meets with a great deal of oppoſition; and faith is ſtrengthened by oppoſition; the nature of faith doth take his riſe by oppoſition; the more oppoſition it meets with, the higher it riſes: The woman of <hi>Canaan,</hi> what oppoſition did her faith meet with? that w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich was a diſcouragement to her, yet from that diſcouragement, her faith takes a riſe; and becauſe Chriſt ſays; ſhe is a dog, therefore ſhe is confident that ſhe ſhall have Crumbs of mercy before ſhe goes away: When faith is put to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, then it becomes ſtrong: When faith is exerciſed in extremity; I having wavered a long time, at laſt it ſees that it muſt either beleeve or periſh, beleeve or ſink; it fares in ſuch a condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as with a man that is to paſs over a River, he being afraid that the Bridge ſhould not bear him, ſtays long before he dare venture; at laſt he ſees the River ſwell higher and higher, he goes to make an offer, and puls back his foot; he dare not venture; at laſt the water ſwels up to the neck of the Bridge, and he ſees there is no way but one with him, either he muſt venture upon the Bridge, or elſe periſh in the water; and then he conſiders, that many have gone over that way, and many have been ſaved that way, and it hath born up many, thouſands have gone over before,

God he puts faith many times to it, puts it to ſuch a ſtrait that the ſoul muſt venture or periſh, believe in Chriſt alone, or periſh; faith here many times takes a riſe; that's the firſt way whereby Chriſt doth coummunicate much of himſelf in affliction, he many times lifts up faith, and ſtrengthens faith; Now the more ſtrong faith is, the more it ſees, the more it apprehends of God.</p>
            <p>Secondly, He pours out the Spirit of <hi>Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> many times upon his people when they are in low conditions; he makes them to cry out, to cry a main to him, as he cryed to his Father in his diſtreſs, he puts up his cries; He <hi>puts up his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thirdly, The Lord Jeſus by affliction, or in affliction he <hi>draws the hearts of his people nigher;</hi> Then he doth bring them back many times from their wandrings, from their ſtraglings: <hi>Before I was afflicted I went aſtray,</hi> ſaith <hi>David.</hi> The Lord Jeſus by affliction, he brings them nigher to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he cauſes them to wait more upon him, to

            <p>Fourthly, He manifeſts moſt of himſelf in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, <hi>by his word which be ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g: Now the word of grace the word of Promiſe, it is the Chariot on which Chriſt rides; he doth by them draw nigh, by his word he draws nigh to the ſoul: and therefore when the word comes with evidence, Chriſt comes along with the word, and then the ſoul ſees moſt of Chriſt, becauſe Chriſt ſends ſuch a word to the ſoul in affliction; which word he comes along with &amp; in which word he conveys himſelf to them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> It may be ſome of God people will ſay, Alas if this be true, that Chriſt manifeſts moſt of himſelf in affliction, what ſhall become of me?

            <p>Firſt of all, he knows that they have moſt need of him, they have moſt need of him becauſe of the weakneſs of the fleſh; and becauſe of the ſtrength of temptation; he knows the fleſh is weak; and therefore he expreſſeth pity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to his Diſciples, when they could expect nothing but fury from him, they could not watch one hour, when he ſtood in need of them; and yet the Lord Jeſus pities them; <hi>The fleſh is weak, but the Spirit is ſtrong;</hi> he knows what the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh is; and he himſelf was partaker of our fleſh, that he might know experimentally what the weakneſs of the fleſh is; and therefore well might <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſay, <hi>He was a man of ſorrow; a man of ſorrow, and acqua<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Again, He knows the ſtrength of temptation, he knows what it is for a poor creature to be tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pred, for <hi>he was in all things tempted like unto us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle: He had experience of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of temptations; he knows how to releeve his people under temptation, he knows, their ſtraits, when they are beſieged; he knows how the force of Satans Batteries are; he knows that in their weakneſſes the Devil takes advantage againſt them, and then above all other times in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:57453:94"/> to drive home the darts of his temptation into their Spirits; and therefore the Lord Jeſus becauſe they have moſt need of him, he pities them, and relieves them at that time.</p>
            <p>Again, He remembers the kindneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to him in his low condition, and therefore will ſhew the like kindneſs to his people in their low conditions; he remembers that his Father did not leave him in his ſtraits, and therefore he will not leave them in their ſtraits: The kindneſs that God the Father ſhewed to his Son when he was upon earth, took ſuch an impreſſion, made ſuch an impreſſion upon the heart of Chriſt that he can never forget it; but he will always labour to requite it, by ſhewing the like kindneſs to the people of God in their diſtreſs: Oh how was he taken with that kindneſs, that <hi>The Father would not leave him alone?</hi> how often doth he make mention of it; <hi>I am not alone, but the Father is with me?</hi> and therefore he enquires for ſome of the Saints of God, that he may ſhew the like kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs unto them: <hi>David</hi> remembers the kindneſs that <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſhewed him, when he was in his low condition; and therefore <hi>David</hi> enquires for ſome of his children; <hi>Is there none left of the houſe of Soul, that I may ſhew kindneſs to for Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thans ſake?</hi> though there be but one poor lame <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> one that is lame of his feet, that is no fit companion for a King; yet for <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſake, and for the kindneſs <hi>Jonathan</hi> ſhewed to <hi>David: David</hi> ſhews great kindneſs to <hi>Jonathans</hi> ſon, took him, and ſet him at his Table: ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt deal, he remembers the kindneſs of his Father, the kindneſs the Father ſhewed him in
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:57453:94"/> his low condition; ſays he, is there none of the ſeed of God? are there none of the children of the moſt high, that I may ſhew kindneſs to, for the fathers ſake? Becauſe he ſhewed kindneſs to me in my low condition; and though he can hear of none but poor lame <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> yet he ſhews kindneſs to them, takes them into commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with himſelf, ſets them at Table with him, and in the midſt of their low conditions will afford his preſence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> becauſe his Father &amp; their Father did not leave him alone when he was in low conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Again, The Lord Jeſus he is bound unto this by many ingagements; I ſay, he is bound to be preſent with his people in low conditions; He is bound by his <hi>Word,</hi> by his <hi>Promiſe,</hi> by the <hi>Law of love</hi> that is in his heart: <hi>All my delight is in the Saints, and thoſe that be excellent;</hi> it is a ſecond Heaven to him, next to the preſence of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he delights to be in the preſence of his Saints, and therefore becauſe he delights in them he will be preſent with them, though they be in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in chains and fetters, though they be in the fiery Furnace; yet it is a Heaven unto Chriſt to be with them; <hi>for all his delight is in his Saints;</hi> He is bound alſo by the <hi>Law of friendſhip,</hi> to be with them in low conditions; a friend is tryed in adverſity; it was a reproof to <hi>Huſhai,</hi> when he left <hi>David</hi> in ſtraits; and therefore ſays <hi>Abſolom,</hi> is this thy kindneſs to thy friend that thou wouldſt not go along with thy friend? It ſhall never be ſaid ſo of the Lord Jeſus, it ſhall never be ſaid of him, Why didſt thou not go along with thy friend? for he will go along with his friend in the greateſt adverſity: he will not leave them, but afford them his preſence.</p>
            <pb n="173" facs="tcp:57453:95"/>
            <p>Again, He is bound becauſe his work is in hand; A Phyſician is bound to look after his Patient, becauſe he hath given him a Purge: And ſo the The Lord Jeſus is bound to look after his Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent when he hath given him a Purge: Gold-Smith is bound to look after his Gold when he hath put it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into the Furnace: And ſo the Lord Jeſus is bound to look after his Gold when 'tis in the Furnace of affliction.</p>

Oh that every man would ſet down and conſider that which <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of, to remember the days of darkneſſe, which will be many; many days of darkneſſe may come upon the earth, what a favour will it be to have a friend in the darkneſſe? a friend that will ſtick by thee when thou art in the dark a friend that thou mayſt take hold of his skirts when thou art in the dark Entry; a friend that will hold thee faſt when thou art in the dark: ſuch a friend is Jeſus Chriſt to all that do embrace him: Oh what a favour, what a mercy will it be, to have a friend ſtand by thee, that is both able and willing to help thee, when all Creature-comforts ſhall fail, when the very ſtrength of body ſhall fail? to have a friend ſtand by to help and ſuccour? and truly ſuch a friend is the Lord Jeſus: what ſaith the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> in the 73. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> verſ. 26. <hi>My fleſh and my heart faileth, but God is the ſtrength of my heart, and my portion for ever:</hi> heart and fleſh fail, and then there is a ſtrength above na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; the Lord then is the ſtrength of my heart, and of my fleſh and blood: What a mercy will it be, to have one ſtand by you, when you go through the valley of the ſhadow of death, a friend then to comfort, a friend then to uphold? ſuch a friend is the Lord to his people; <hi>David</hi> was confident of this, therefore you ſee how his faith triumpheth in the conſideration of it, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23, verſ. 4. <hi>Yea though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear none ill;</hi> Why? <hi>For thou art with me;</hi> ſee what a mighty confidence was raiſed up in <hi>Davids</hi> heart; and what was the

Oh do but think in what ſteed Jeſus Chriſt will ſtand you, when the ſtorms ariſe, and the waves ſhall beat when it may be the body of the Ship ſhall be ſplit, in pieces; Oh what will it be then for a Saviour
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:57453:97"/> to uphold the Spirit, to bear up the ſpirit, and take the ſoul upon his own ſhoulder, to bear it above wrath and amazement? Now do you ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend this to be deſireable?

Oh then I ſay, accept of him, he freely tenders himſelf to you now in this day of grace; and Oh that the day of grace might not be ſlighted! his preſence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſireable in ſuch a ſtrait; and is he not now deſirea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that ſo you may have him in ſuch a time of need?</p>
            <p>But Thirdly, This let's us ſee, that there is not ſuch great evil in affliction as men apprehend; men fear affliction, and flee from affliction as from Toads and Serpents, and connot endure to think of affliction, cannot endure to think of the day of darkneſſe: I ſay, there is not ſo great an evil in affliction as men apprehend, for the Lord Jeſus is preſent with his people in affliction; and there is no reaſon why you that are the people of God ſhould inordinately fear affliction, and why you ſhould inordinately ſeek to be delivered from affliction; ſeeing you may poſſibly enjoy more of the preſence of Jeſus Chriſt in affliction, then ever you did in other conditions? would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </note> God to fear affliction inordinately:</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, Either they do not beleeve that they ſhall meet with the preſence of Chriſt in an afflicted condition. Or</p>
            <p n="2">2. Secondly, They do not beleeve that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt will countervail the bitterneſs of affliction.</p>
            <p>Now I ſhall endeavour to clear both theſe, and to perſwade you that are the people of God: Firſt of all, that you ſhall certainly meet with Chriſt in affliction: And then that his preſence will countervail the bitterneſs of affliction.</p>
            <p>Firſt I ſay, You ſhall certainly meet with Chriſt in your affliction; for firſt of all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he hath ſpoke it, he hath promiſed it, he hath ſet a part the time and place of his own appointment; he hath given out the word, the word is out of his

                  </gap>vers, they ſhall not overflow thee, when thou paſſeſt through the fire thou ſhalt not be burnt, neither ſhall the flame kindle upon thee:</hi> the fire, that is in the greateſt ſtraits: in thy greateſt affliction, when the waters are ready to overwhelm thee, I will be with thee, and lift up thy head; I will be with thee in fiery tryals, when flames are ready to conſume thee, I will be with thee: I ſay, you may be confident of it, becauſe the Lord Chriſt hath given it under his hand and ſeal, that he will give your ſouls a meeting in ſuch a condition; is there any thing that can hinder Chriſt from performing this his promiſe; he cannot forget his word, he cannot miſtake the time and place, he cannot be hindred by any outward impediment: I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Firſt of all, He cannot forget his Promiſe, though he hath ſpoken many years ago, yet the Lord he cannot forget his promiſe; he is always mindful of his promiſe: See in the firſt of <hi>Chron.</hi> and the 16.

            <p>Again, He cannot miſtake the time, happily a man though he hath promiſed, yet he may mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake the time, he knows not how the time paſſes, and ſo may be deceived; but it cannot be ſo with God, he knows all times, all creatures; <hi>Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>know<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Nay, he cannot be hindred by any impediment; his Father will not hinder him; he was willing to ſpare him out of Heaven for many years together, that ſo he might be preſent with his people, and all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures cannot hinder him from performing his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; ſee the 27. of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> verſe 4. <hi>Fury is not in me, who would ſet the Bryars and Thornes againſt me in battel?

            <p>Again Secondly, You may be confident of his preſence in affliction, becauſe affliction is, for this end, it is the main end that Chriſt in affliction may meet with his people, that he may draw them into <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>igher communion with himſelf, that they may ſee more of him, &amp; that they may enjoy more of him, and he enjoy more of them; that he may
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:57453:99"/> make uſe of affliction to remove that which is in the way between him and the ſoul, to ſubdue cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and to ſtrengthen faith, and to draw forth grace, to heighten the holineſs, and the grace of the ſoul; and to comfort the heart, and all that the ſoul may enjoy more communion with Chriſt; he doth take his people into a by-Lane, as I may ſay, in every affliction that he may ſpeak unto them; he <hi>took the Spouſe into the wilderneſs that he might ſpeak to her;</hi> and ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt when he takes his people into a by-way, it is, that he may ſpeak ſomething more to them, that he may ſpeak freely, and ſpeak ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that may be for their good; he doth not ſpeak in affliction, becauſe he delights in afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, he doth not delight in their afflictions; he doth not afflict that he may be ſatisfied: no, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions they are not their puniſhments, for God hath ſatisfaction at the hand of Jeſus Chriſt, and therefore it relates to ſomething to come, that he may with this Chaſtiſement draw the ſoul more nigh, and ſee more of him, and enjoy more of him, more of his preſence, of his love, more communion with him, that he may comfort, ſtrengthen and ſupport, and ſanctifie: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing it is the end, the main end of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that Jeſus Chriſt and his people may meet and converſe together; certainly Gods people muſt not ſlight this his afflicting them, muſt not ſlight this main end of God.</p>
            <p>Object. <hi>But if Chriſt do meet with his people in affliction, the preſence of Chriſt cannot countervail the bitterneſs of the affliction.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> But it will to the full, for there is that
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:57453:99"/> in the preſence of Chriſt, which may ſupply the wants of all creatures: I ſay, there is all good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, all ſweetneſſe gathered together in the Son of God, which is ſcattered up and down in Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and therefore in Heaven the Saints need no creature comforts, they need not the light of the Sun, nor the light of the Moon; and there all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable relations are broken a pieces, there is no husband, nor wife, nor child, Maſter, nor ſervant; why? becauſe the good of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ll theſe lations do meet in Chriſt, and the good of all theſe relations ſhall be ſupplied by the preſence of Chriſt, and therefore Chriſt tells his Diſciples in <hi>Mat</hi> 22. 30. <hi>In the Reſurrection,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>they neither marry nor are given in Marriage, but are as the Angels of God in Heaven:</hi> they neither marry nor are given in Marriage; that which is the moſt comfortable relation in earth there is no need of in Heaven, 'tis too poor, too needy for Heaven, there ſhall be no marrying nor giving in Marriage; and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o the comfort of all other relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall be found in Chriſt. In him there is a perfection of all goodneſſe, of all ſweetneſſe; now you cannot meet with the fulneſſe of theſe in any condition; there is a fulneſſe of joy in Chriſt, a fulneſſe of good in Chriſt; what ſays the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt in <hi>Pſalm</hi> 16. v. laſt. <hi>In thy preſence is fulneſſe of joy, at thy right hand are pleaſures for evermore.</hi> there is a fulneſſe of joy in the preſence of Chriſt, there is not a fulneſſe of ſorrow in any condition, no, there is a mixture of Mercy in every conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; the evil that a Soul meets with is not infinite, there is not a fulneſſe of ſorrow, but in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt there is a fulneſſe of joy, there is
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:57453:100"/> that which can abundantly countervail the evil that is met with in any condition; if all the evil un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun were met together in one condition, and a Soul brought into it, yet it might find in the preſence of Chriſt that which may anſwer that condition, the preſence of Chriſt will comfort, and ſupport, and raiſe up a Soul in that evil con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition; and therefore you ſhall find that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of Chriſt hath made the Saints to rejoyce in Tribulations, to joy abundantly. The Apoſtles rejoyced that they were counted worthy to ſuffer for the Name of the Lord Chriſt: it doth fill the Soul with holy joy, heavenly Raptures, yea the preſence of Chriſt hath been aſtoniſhment to the Soul many times when it hath been in a ſad condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: ſee what <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith of himſelf in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 2. <hi>I knew a man in Chriſt about</hi> 14 <hi>years ago, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the Bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Fourthly, Let the people of God expect the preſence of Chriſt in their affliction, in their low condition; ſeeing Chriſt hath promiſed his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, do you expect his preſence, look for his preſence: Oh that we might labour to improve our affliction for this end, that we may meet with more of Chriſt, that we may enjoy more of the preſence of Chriſt in our affliction; truly there is a great deal loſt, Gods people looſe abundance of ſweetneſs which they might enjoy both in Ordinances and in affl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I ſay firſt of all, Undoubtedly there is the preſence of Chriſt with thee, and thou canſt not but thou mayſt ſee ſomething, if unthankfulneſſe doth not lye before thine eyes; he is there, the Lord Jeſus is there, and he will make good his word; certainly if he hath promiſed to be with his people in afflicted conditions, he will make good his word; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Secondly, Yea I ſay ſecondly, That if thou doſt not ſee more of the preſence of Chriſt, the fault is in thee, 'tis not in the Lord, not in the word of the Lord, he is preſent according to the word that he hath ſpoke; and therefore Chriſt may be preſent and thou ſeeſt him not becauſe through negligence thou doſt not ſtir up thy ſelf to take hold of him, thou giveſt way to a ſlothful ſpirit, and ſo thou doſt not ſtir up thy ſelf to take hold of him, or elſe thou doſt not exerciſe faith in thy afflicted condition, and then no wonder though Chriſt be with thee, and thou ſeeſt him not: Faith is the eye of the ſoul, and if that be ſhut Chriſt may ſtand at the right hand and the ſoul not diſcern him: and therefore I ſay, ſtir

            <p>Nay, here is further matter of Thankfulneſs, that he ſhould afford his own preſence to his people; If the Lord had ſent a Meſſenger to comfort a poor af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted Creature, we ſhould have thought it a great mercy; but that he ſhould afford his own preſence in affliction, that he ſhould come himſelf to ſupport and ſtrengthen, what a double mercy is this?

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> I ſay Believe; Believe that Chriſt is preſent with thee; I ſpeak to every ſoul that hath made a cloſe with Jeſus Chriſt in the tenders of grace; I ſay, 'tis thy duty to believe that he is with thee in thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted condition: Believe it, though thou ſeeſt not the effects of his preſence, and that is the way to ſee; believe that he is preſent according to his word, and through the grace of God, thou ſhalt ſee the effect of his preſence; only Chriſt would have us to believe his word, Chriſt would have thee believe that he keeps time and place with them, and that he is with them in afflicted conditions; yea he deals with his people as <hi>Jobs</hi> friends dealt with him, they came to viſit <hi>Job</hi> in his affliction, but ſate them down ſeven days, and ſpake not a word unto <hi>Job,</hi> and at laſt they found an oportunity to ſpeak; even ſo doth Jeſus Chriſt, it may be he may ſit ſeven days and not ſpeak

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E ſhall not ſeek far for the ſence of the words, we ſhall finde the ſence in themſelves: Some conceive that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake in the perſon of the natural man, or the Atheiſt, who keep this Counſel; <hi>Follow after the world, enjoy thy pleaſure and thy profit, and do it with all thy might, for thou haſt no long time to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy them in; there is nothing in the grave, and therefore now take thy fill.</hi> But I rather conceive that <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpake here as a <hi>Prophet,</hi> in the perſon of a <hi>Prophet,</hi> and ſpiritual man, and gives better Counſel then this, from the ſeventh <hi>verſe,</hi> unto the end of the
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:57453:106"/> Chapter. He gives advice in the ſeventh verſe, to take the comforts of thoſe things that God hath given: And upon this Account, <hi>Becauſe the Lord accepts thy works: Goe thy way, eat thy Bread with joy, and drink thy Wine with a merry heart, for God now accepts thy works:</hi> And ſo in the ninth verſe: <hi>Live joyfully with thy Wife whom thou loveſt, all the days of the life of thy vanity;</hi> not with the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, as the Atheiſt would have ſpoken; but with the wife whom thou loveſt: And ſo alſo this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel in the Text, ſeems to be given by <hi>Solomon,</hi> in the perſon of a ſpiritual man: <hi>Whatſoever thy hand finds to do, do it with all thy might, for there is no working in the Grave,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>The wiſe man here gives counſel unto all men to improve the time of life, he calls all men to activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in the time of life: And firſt he declares where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men ought to be active, <hi>Whatſoever thy hand findes to do:</hi> Whatſoever is in thine hand to do (as ſome read it) Whatſoever God puts into thy hand to do, in thy general or particular Calling, more eſpecially in the great Affairs that do concern the world to come, whatſoever thy hand finde to do in relation unto the ſtate of Eternity, whatſoever thy hand finde to do; a man finds that ſometime which he ſeeketh, and ſometimes that which he ſeeketh not: After thou haſt ſought out the mind of God, and doſt know what is his will concerning thee; when thy hand hath found out what to do, then do it with thy might; or if the Lord ſhall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent thee with his goodneſſe, and ſhall diſcover his will to thee, when thou ſoughteſt not after it; Oh then give up thy ſelf to work the work of God, and do it with all thy might: And then he ſhews in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:57453:106"/> the ſecond place, how men muſt work theſe works of God; <hi>do it with all thy might,</hi> with all diligence, with all faithfulneſs; lay forth thy ſelf to the very utmoſt for God; do it with thy might: This he preſſeth with two Arguments.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>There is no work in the grave,</hi> there is no work to be done there, that is the place of reſt, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ere is no poſſibility of working; if thou wouldſt work afterward, thou canſt not, thou ſhalt not be able to work, there is no poſſibility of working for God, and for thy ſoul, when once in the grave; there is no beleeving, there is no repenting, there is no turning to God, when once in the grave; if it be not done before thou comeſt there, it is like to be undone for ever; <hi>There is no work in the Grave.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And ſecondly, as there is no work in the grave, ſo <hi>there is no device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdome,</hi> there is no means to accompliſh work; if there were any work to be done in the grave; there is no means to accompliſh this work, there is no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in the grave. This Argument is further backed by the conſideration of the haſtening of that eſtate of death, where there ſhall be no poſſibility of working; there is no work in the grave <hi>whither thou goeſt:</hi> He doth not ſay there is no work in the in the grave whither thou ſhalt go; but whither thou goeſt, thou hadſt need make haſt; for thou art going Thou, and Thou, and every one, thou goeſt to the grave, thou art making poſt haſt thither, thou art going every moment, thou art every moment ſtepping over the Threſhold of Eternity: And therefore the Reſult of all is this.</p>
            <p>Whatſoever God ſhall lay before thee to be thy
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:57453:107"/> work, whatſoever thou haſt to do for God, or for thy ſoul, in the great buſineſs of Eternity, do not dally with it, do not defer it, do not put it off, there is no work in the grave, there is no poſſibility of working there: If thou wouldſt, there is no means to accompliſh work there: And this condition is haſtning upon thee, thou art ſtepping into the grave every moment, thither thou goeſt; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith, what thou doeſt, <hi>do it with thy might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall faſten upon this one conſideration to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute at this time.</p>
            <p>Obſervat. <hi>That it concerns every living man to do with his might, whatſoever he hath to do for God, or for his own ſoul, in that great buſineſs that doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern Eternity.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It concernes every living man and woman, to do with all their might, what ever they have to do with all their might, whatever they have to do for God, or for their own ſouls in the great buſineſs that doth concern Eternity.</p>
            <p>I ſhall here ſhew you, Firſt, what it is for a man to do with his might.</p>
            <p>Secondly what are thoſe things that God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires of every one of you to be done with your might; And that will make way for the Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, What is to do with thy might?</p>
            <p>To do <hi>with thy might;</hi> Firſt, is to do with <hi>dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence,</hi> to do <hi>diligently,</hi> to take all opportunities of doing for God; yea ſeek opportunities, not only embrace opportunities, but ſeek opportunities of doing for God: Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt went up and down doing good, in the days of his fleſh;
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:57453:107"/> he ſought opportunities to ſerve his Father, and to ſerve the ſons of men.</p>
            <p>The Sun carries his light up and down the world, and viſits poor Creatures that are in darkneſs; when a man is faithful in taking opportunities to do for God, in ſeeking opportunities, when a man works with diligence, then he works with his might.</p>
            <p>Again ſecondly, <hi>To do with thy might;</hi> to do with a mans might, is to do or work <hi>reſolutely;</hi> to do with reſolution, not to be beaten back by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements, and by oppoſition, that doth lye in the way; never did any work meet with ſo much oppoſition, as the great work of our Redemption by Chriſt; But he brake through Divels and all the powers of darkneſs that were in his way, he did with his might the work of his Father, for he did it with reſolution: To go on notwithſtanding all ſtorms, all winds that blow, though never ſo many dangers lay in a mans way, though there ſeem to be Lions in the way, great enemies, great perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions, loſſe of name, loſſe of eſtate, loſſe of friends, to go through evil report, as well as good, to break through the ſtrife of Tongues, and the ſtrife of hands: This is to work Reſolutely, this is to do with a mans might.</p>
            <p>Again thirdly, to do with a mans might, is to do <hi>faithfully;</hi> when a man works faithfully, and ſincerely, when he doth not warp nor turn aſide; when he is not byaſſed nor drawn by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world: In the 33. of <hi>Deut.</hi> it is ſaid that <hi>Levi did not know his own Father, nor his own Mother, nor his children:</hi> he did the work of God with all his might, for he did it faithfully: And
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:57453:108"/> when the cauſe of God was in hand, he knew no friend, he knew not his Father, he knew not his children; <hi>Get thee behind me Satan,</hi> ſaith Chriſt to <hi>Peter,</hi> a dear friend, a choſen Diſciple; yet when <hi>Peter</hi> will diſſwade Chriſt from doing the work of his Father, <hi>Peter</hi> is a Satan, he is an adverſary; <hi>get th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e behind me Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> And ſo, <hi>what do you mean to vex my heart?</hi> ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> when his friends diſſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him, <hi>I am ready not only to be bound, but to dye at Jeruſalem for the name of Chriſt.</hi> When a man works faithfully, then he works with his might.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, when a man works <hi>ſpiritually,</hi> then he works with his might: When his heart goes into the work, when the ſpirit goes into the work, when a man is content not only to give God the outſide, but his heart ſhall be engaged, and that ſhall bow to God, and ſubmit to Chriſt: If he do not find that his heart and ſpirit is engaged in the work; he cannot be ſatisfied: It is ſaid of good <hi>Joſiah,</hi> in the 2 of Kings, 23. verſ. 25. there was none like to him, there was none like before him, <hi>that turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his ſoul, and with all his might:</hi> He turned with his heart and ſoul, his heart and Spirit was engaged in it; and therefore now he did it with his might.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, when a man works with his might he works <hi>ſpeedily;</hi> I ſay ſpeedily: Our Lord Jeſus did the work of his Father with his migh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan betimes, in the morning; he was called <hi>the Hind in the morning;</hi> he was hunted betimes in the morning; He began betimes to work the works of his Father: when he was thirteen years of age, he was found diſputing among the Doctors, and ſaith he, <hi>Wiſt you not that I muſt do the work of my</hi>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:57453:108"/> 
               <hi>Father?</hi> To begin betimes in the day of youth, to take the beſt ſeaſon, the fitteſt opportunity to do for God; when a man doth ſpeedily, then he doth with his might.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, When a man doth <hi>strenuouſly,</hi> when he doth with all his ſtrength, with all thoſe abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties God hath given him; when he is content that God ſhould have all that he hath; that God ſhould ſerve himſelf of the beſt he hath, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce that he hath any thing for God; when a man lays down himſelf, and lays down all at the foot-ſtool of God, &amp; ſaith, Lord take me, and take mine, and improve me to the utmoſt of thy ſelf; it mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters not what become of the Creature, ſo God may be glorified; when a man works thus, he works <hi>ſtrenuouſly</hi> and with all his might.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and laſtly, when a man works <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly:</hi> When a man holds out unto the end, when he is willing to abide with Jeſus Chriſt, yea to abide with Chriſt in his tribulation; when he is willing to ſerve the Lord all the ſix days of his life; when he is content that his works and his life ſhould be finiſhed together, and not one before the other: Thus it was with our Lord Jeſus Chriſt when he was upon the Croſs, his work and his life were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when a man works thus to the end, this man works with his might. That is the firſt Particular, we haſten to the ſecond: You have heard what it is for a man to work with his might.</p>
            <p>The ſecond follows: <hi>What thoſe things are that every man ought to do with his might.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall ſpeak firſt to <hi>Sinners,</hi> and then to <hi>Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> and ſhew both their works: Something the
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:57453:109"/> Lord requires of both to be done thus, with all their might.</p>
            <p>If Sinners ask what is their work? I anſwer; <note place="margin">What the work of ſinners is to be done with their might.</note> Firſt, their work is <hi>to know themſelves:</hi> To know that they are poor and miſerable, blind and naked, that they are loſt and undone; that they are with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out light, and without life, and without ſtrength, and without hope for eternity; that they have ſinned, and cannot ſatisfie; that they have loſt themſelves, and cannot return of themſelves; that they have done evil, and cannot do better of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves: If free-grace do not prevent them, they are as poor wandring ſheep upon the Mountains; they are like to wander, and wander, and wander for ever, till they be ſeparated everlaſtingly from the Lord, if the good Shepherd of ſouls do not go forth to ſeek and ſave them: That is the firſt thing that doth concern them to know, ſeek after this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg, and that ſpeedily, with all your might.</p>
            <p>Secondly to know the Lord Jeſus; it concerns the ſinner to ſearch after the knowledg of Chriſt, to know that he is the only Mediator between God and man; to know that all pardon, all peace, and all grace, and all ſtrength, and all holineſſe, it muſt come in through the blood of Jeſus Chriſt; that this Lord Jeſus is freely held forth to loſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; he is tendred by free promiſe, or Covenant of grace: and that men are invited every where to return to the Lord, to deny themſelves, their own works, their own righteouſneſs, their own wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſſe, and to ſubmit to the righteouſneſſe of the Son of God, that everlaſting righteouſneſs that Jeſus Chriſt hath brought in by his blood. To ſeek after this knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, is the ſecond
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:57453:109"/> great work that ſinners have to do.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, To beleeve in Jeſus Chriſt; this is an other work: To believe in the name of Jeſus Chriſt, Oh this is the great work! when poor ſinners came to Chriſt, and askt him what work they ſhould do: How they ſhould work the works of God? he tells them, that this is the work of God, <hi>To beleeve in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> Joh. 6. 29. this is the work of God, this is the great work, the firſt work, all other works are not accepted, till this be done: This is the firſt born of graces, this is the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſouls ſtrength; and till this be done, all other works are loſt, becauſe, <hi>without faith, it is not poſſible to pleaſe God;</hi> All the time of their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in unbelief in the wilderneſſe, it was a time of temptation and provocation; this is the great work, the work of God, which meets with moſt oppoſition; all within a man, and all the powers of darkneſſe do make againſt it; and therefore it concerns poor ſinners to ſeek after this great work of God, with all their might; they can never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin too ſoon, never begin too ſpeedily; it is a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty work, if you had hundreds of years to live, you would finde time little enough to beleeve in, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe faith in. I ſhall go no further with ſinners, for till this work is done, nothing is accepted. And therefore, Oh that God would perſwade the hearts of poor ſinners to know that this is their work, To know themſelves, and to know Chriſt, and to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve in his Name! Oh that the Lord would ſtir them up to ſeek after it with their might!</p>
            <p>But what is the work of Beleevers? What muſt <note place="margin">What Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers muſt do with their might.</note> they do with their might?</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, To ſeek after further knowledge of
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:57453:110"/> their God, and Communion with him, acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with him, fellowſhip with him; to know more of him in his Attributes, in his Son, in his Word, the myſteries of his Kingdome; to know the truth of the Times, the will of God concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you. Oh, this is a great work, it concerns you to ſeek after this with all your might: to wait up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God in all means for it.</p>
            <p>To wait at wiſdoms Poſts, to climbe upon every Sycamore Tree, where Jeſus Chriſt is wont to paſs by; to ſet your ſouls under every Golden-Pipe, where there is ſaving knowledge of Chriſt to be Communicated to you, or further acquaintance with God; Breath more after him, thus did <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> in Pſal. 63. <hi>O God thou art my God, early will I ſeek thee, my ſoul thirſteth for thee, my fleſh long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for thee in a dry and thirſty Land, where no water is;</hi> He doth not only thirſt; but he longs: Now longing is a mighty ſtrong deſire; How dangerous is it to the Creature, if longing be not ſatisfied? With this deſire of longing was <hi>Davids</hi> ſoul carried after further acquaintance with God, further en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of him; That's the firſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, The ſecond work that you have to do with your might, you that have intereſt in Chriſt, is to get your hearts fully rooted, and fully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed upon the promiſes, that you may not be left at uncertainties in the great matters of your everlaſting welfares; to get your hearts built, I ſay, eſtabli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>hed upon the Promiſes, rooted in Chriſt, to get your Acquittance cleered up to you, cleerly written, and wait till the Lord ſhall teach you to read it; that you may be able to ſay as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle, in <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33. <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the</hi>
               <pb n="219" facs="tcp:57453:110"/> 
               <hi>charge of Gods Elect? it is God that juſtifieth, it is Chriſt that dyed, and is riſen again, and ſits at the right hand of God, and makes interceſſion for us;</hi> I ſay, you had need be perfect in your evidence for Heaven; there may come a time of darkneſs, black clouds may come over all your comforts, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent enjoyments: a black night of temptation may be upon you, the Divel may caſt a miſt before your eyes; and therefore you had need be perfect to read your evidence for Heaven, that you may be able to read, and to know your intereſt in Chriſt, in ſuch a condition as that is: Oh do this, make haſt to do this, do it with your might.</p>
            <p>Third<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> To ſerve God in your generation, is another work you have to do with your might; to ſerve God in your generation is that you have to do, and Oh that you would do it with all your might, to honour and lift up God upon earth, to make him glorious, to lift him up by your praiſes, to lift him up by your converſations, by your obedience, by your ſhining in the midſt of a crooked and ſinful generation: The Lord he hath put his Name upon you Chriſtians for this end; he put his Spirit into you to inable you to this: He expects more from you then from others; the eyes of the world are upon you, and God ſhall either reap honour, or diſhonour by you; therefore it concerns you, I ſay, to do the work of your generation with all your might, to ſeek wherein you may be ſerviceable to the Lord how you may advance his Name: That is the third work, to lift up God by the ſervice of your Generation.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, It concerns you to get your hearts made ſenſible of the periſhing condition of the
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:57453:111"/> Creature, of the fading condition of all things under the Sun, that you are fading Creatures, your life fades, and comforts fade: The Lord would have you ſeek with all your might, to have ſuch impreſſions as theſe made upon your ſpirits: 'tis a hard matter to receive them; and therefore God bids the <hi>Prophet</hi> cry, in Iſa. 40. <hi>The voice ſays cry, What ſhall I cry? all fleſh is graſs, and the glory of it as the flower in the field, the graſs withereth, and the flower fadeth.</hi> The Prophet muſt cry, and cry again, before men will hear this, before this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion will be made upon the ſpirits of men, That they are fading men, and their comforts are fading; That they are as graſs, and their comforts as the graſs: You had need live in a continual converſe with your fading condition, dye daily, ſee death at a diſtance, and grapple with death at a diſtance: Put your ſelves into a dying condition, and ſay of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, Oh! what if this were my laſt? What if I were now to breath forth my ſoul? What if now to ſhoot the Gulf of Eternity? What have I now to rely upon? What have I to carry me through? How ſhall death be conquered? How ſhall the ſting be taken out for me? You had need I ſay, converſe with death at a diſtance, and live conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually in the ſence of your dying condition; that ſo death may not be terrible when it comes, that you may know before hand how to conquer it, and that it is conquered by the blood of the Lamb.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Another work that you have to do with your might, is to do good to your friends, and to your Relations. Chriſtians, give out the good things to your Relations, and do it ſpeedily, do it with all your might: Impart the knowledge of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:57453:111"/> God to your Relations, Chriſt finds <hi>Andrew,</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> finds <hi>Simon Peter;</hi> Chriſt finds <hi>Philip,</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> finds <hi>Nathaniel; Oh come, ſaith he, we have found the Saviour, the Meſſias,</hi> 1 Joh. 41. 45. You have but a little while to be with your Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and they are gone, they are taken from you, and you from them; and therefore with all your might work this work, and do them good, and give out good to your Relations. That is the fifth work that you have to do with all your might.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, In all your waitings upon God, ſee that you do there with your might; I ſay, when ever you wait upon God in every Duty, in every Ordinance, whenſoever you draw nigh to God, the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you ſhould do it with your might. In the ſecond of <hi>Samuel,</hi> the 13. it is ſaid there, that <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> when he danced before the Ark, <hi>he did it with all his might:</hi> And ſo in the ſecond of <hi>Chron.</hi> 28. It is ſaid there, that <hi>David</hi> when he offered unto the Lord, he <hi>offered with all his might.</hi> And ſo that place, in 2 <hi>King.</hi> 23. and 25. It is ſaid that King <hi>Joſiah</hi> turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his might; what ever you do in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, do it not lazily: If you pray, do it with your might, and if you hear, let it not be done, but with all your might; and if you ſpeak, do with your might; becauſe theſe are mighty things, and they have relation to the buſineſs of Eternity.</p>
            <p>Seventhly and Laſtly; To mortifie your corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to get your luſts mortified, ſubdued, caſt out, your ſouls more conformable to Chriſt; this is an other work, and the laſt work that I ſhall name, that you Chriſtians and Beleevers have to do, and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:57453:112"/> that with your might: To get your luſts mortified and ſubdued; Do it with your might, do not look upon it as an eaſie matter, as a frivolous buſineſs; Do not go out againſt ſuch Giants with ſtraw and Bulruſh: But Oh! get the compleat Armour of God, go forth in the name of Chriſt, in the ſtrength of Chriſt, with the blood of Chriſt, with with the promiſes of Chriſt, it is a work of great concernment; and therefore I beſeech you do it in good earneſt, go out in the Name of the Lord, and do this great work in good earneſt, that your corruptions may be mortified, and more of the Image and likeneſſe of Chriſt may be imprinted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on your Spirits. And thus have I ſhewed you (my Brethren) what it is for a man to do with his might, and what are thoſe works the Lord puts into your hands to do with all your might: You have heard what works are put into the hands of ſinners, and what works are put into the hands of Beleevers: And now I ſhall make ſome ſhort Application, and I have two words to ſpeak.</p>
            <p>Firſt, The one a word of Caution and Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. The other a word of Exhortation.</p>
            <p>Firſt in the firſt place, a word of Caution and Direction is needful; and let this be the firſt Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>That though God call upon you to work with your might, yet he doth not put you upon it, to work to pay your debt, To diſcharge that great debt of ten thouſand Talents of tranſgreſſions: My Brethren, if you had a thouſand hands to work with, if you could work as much as the very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, it is not poſſible you ſhould work ſo much as ſhould diſcharge the debt: for you could not pay
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:57453:112"/> the leaſt farthing of that which is owing to God: No, know my Brethren, the Father of mercies hath pittyed poor Creatures, he ſent his Son, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for this end, to marry poor Wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow-ſouls, that were left in an infinite debt, and could not diſcharge it; he hath ſent his Son to to pay the debt of every widdow-ſoul, that is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be eſpouſed to Chriſt; he came from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for this end, he wrought with his hands, he had no other way to pay the debt, he left him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf poor; <hi>The L<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>rd Jeſus was rich, but for your ſakes he became poor;</hi> he had no way to pay the debt, but by working with his hands; he wrought hard, he wrought till he ſweat, he wrought till he ſweat drops of water and blood; he wrought three and thirty years together, that he might pay this great debt that was owing, that his people did owe to the Father. And therefore take heed you do not go about, to work to diſcharge your own debt: do not work to pay your debt; but work becauſe your debt is paid and diſcharged by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Take heed you do not work for your living; God calls upon you to work with your might, but he does not put you upon it to work for your living: Life is not from your works, neither ſhould Chriſtians live upon their works; The life of your joy, and the life of your peace; the life of your comforts, the life of your righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, it is not from your works; the Lord never put you upon it, to work for this end: no, Chriſt hath wrought enough for his people, that they might live as his people: he hath provided for their maintenance, to fill their cup; he hath provided for their cloathing; he put mighty righteouſneſs,
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:57453:113"/> everlaſting righteouſneſs upon you; It is not now to do, and live, this is not the Covenant. But the Covenant of grace is, <hi>live and do:</hi> fetch life from Chriſt, and then do, and do with all your might, becauſe life is given freely by Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, God doth not put you upon it to work to purchaſe love, to purchaſe favour, or to purchaſe Heaven: I ſay, you are not to work to purchaſe the favour of God by your works, to purchaſe Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the works of your hands; Alas <hi>Adam</hi> in innocency could not do it: he could not yearn life by working: And how ſhall poor Creatures in a fallen eſtate be able to purchaſe, and yearn life by their own works? No<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> if you will ſeek ſalvation by works, you reſt upon your works; and if you reſt upon your works, you break your works, and both you and your works are like to be loſt for ever: and therefore know my Brethren, you are to do your utmoſt for God; if you could do ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand times more, all is too little for God: But know, that life and ſalvation is not purchaſed by your doing; work as much, and do as much for God, be as diligent in doing the work of God as if life were to be purchaſed by works; but when you have done your utmoſt, renounce all, and know, that by your own works you are no more nigh to Heaven then the very Publicans and Harlots; It is by the door of grace only, that you muſt enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life: That is the third.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, When God calls you to work with your might, he does not call you to work with your own ſtrength: I beſeech you take this Caution along with you, that poor Creatures may not think that they are able to do that which they are called
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:57453:113"/> upon to do: I ſay, the Lord does not call you to work in your own ſtrength; And therefore know, that without Chriſt you can do nothing; you are not fit for the leaſt work, for the leaſt duty: All your ſufficiency muſt come down from Heaven: you cannot beleeve, you cannot re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, you cannot obey, you cannot give glory to God, unleſs this power be given you from on high, you cannot move towards God in any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious action, unleſs the Lord comes in with ſtrength: O therefore, when ever you are to work for God, go and ſet your ſelves under the promiſe; the promiſe of ſtrength and aſſiſtance, Go and look for ſtrength to Chriſt; do not act in your own ſtrength: Oh let your ſouls open to the breathings of the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt: The ſoul never acts graciouſly, but when it is acted by the Spirit of Chriſt: Oh know that you are as a Ship becalmed upon the Sea, and you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſayl, till the ſpirit breath upon you, and fill the ſayle of your affections, and carry you God-ward, and Heaven-ward; and therefore let Chriſt be your ſtrength, wait for his ſtrength, that you may ſay, <hi>Now I live, and yet not I, but it is Chriſt that liveth in me:</hi> I act, and yet not I, it is the Spirit of Chriſt that acts in me: I pray, and yet not I: I beleeve, and yet not I: I obey, and yet not I, it is the Spirit of Chriſt that acts in me, it is his ſtrength that helps me. This is the fourth Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: I beſeech you take heed you do not work in your own ſtrength; you will ſpoil your works.</p>
            <p>Fiftly, Take this Caution, do not preſent your works your ſelves to God: When you
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:57453:114"/> have done your work, go to Jeſus Chriſt, and deſire him to carry your works home: Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans know, it is not for you to carry your work home, it is the Office of Chriſt; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore make uſe of Chriſt, and ſay, Lord preſent this Sacrifice, this Duty; do thou waſh it with thine own blood, and cover it with thine own righteouſneſs: I tell you, your works are not pleaſing, unleſs they come out of the hands of Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt muſt waſh your works, and perfume your works, and ſweeten your works, and preſent your works with acceptation to the Father; and therefore when you have wrought with all your might, let Jeſus Chriſt preſent it to God your Father, and his Father.</p>
            <p>Sixtly, Take heed that when you work with all your might, you work not for your own end: I tell you, good works may be ſpoiled if you work for your own end, if ſelf come in: a man may work the work of a Magiſtrate, or the work of a Miniſter, but if ſelf come in, if vain glory be his end, if the praiſe of men, if his own profit: If the glory of God be not the end he propounds to himſelf, that man will be called by Chriſt another day, <hi>a worker of iniquity: We have caſt out Devils in thy name,</hi> and yet ſaith Chriſt to them, <hi>I know you not, depart from me, ye workers of iniquity</hi> Oh this is the dead fly that ſpoils the Box of Ointment, when a man does it for vain glory, to be ſeen of men, to get a name in the world, and to raiſe their eſtates in the world, when they do publique works for private ends; how ever it ſeems to be glorious, it is ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hominable;
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:57453:114"/> and therefore when ever you work for God, make God your principal: Begin in his ſtrength, and end for his glory.</p>
            <p>The ſecond word, is a word of Exhortation, and I will conclude with that; let me ſpeak in my former order, firſt to Sinners, and then to Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers, and I will be but ſhort.</p>
            <p>Firſt to Sinners, You that have not yet wrought the work of God; you that have not given up your names to Chriſt, in whoſe heart the great work of faith is not yet wrought, You that are found this day working the works of darkneſs, the works of iniquity; Let me ſpeak a word to you, let me reaſon with you thus, in the name of the Lord Jeſus, my Maſter, and yours: What do you think of it my dear friends? does it not concern you? Is not this a work put into your hands, to ſeek after an intereſt in Jeſus Chriſt? to beleeve in his name, to give up your ſelves unto him? is not this work that is put into your hands, that God hath given you to do in this moment of your life? Doth it not concern you to beleeve in the name of Chriſt, think you? <hi>Without faith it is not poſſible to pleaſe God:</hi> If you be found in a way of unbelief, you are found in the way of wrath: It is ſaid the wrath of the Lord does hang over the heads of unbeleevers: If in a ſtate of unbelief, you are in an eſtate of wrath; if in an eſtate of unbelief, you are loſt, and your works are loſt; whatſoever you do without faith, your works cannot be accepted; <hi>without faith you cannot pleaſe God,</hi> without faith you cannot enter into life: And now what think
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:57453:115"/> you my dear friends, is it not a work that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns you, to ſeek after faith in Jeſus Chriſt? If you grant it, let me further urge it upon you; Oh if this be your work, then do it with your might: Oh that the Lord would ſtir up your hearts to do it with your might; There is but a moment to ſeek faith in, there is but a moment to ſeek after an intereſt in Chriſt; and if this be not done now, O when ſhal it be done? If it be not done now, it is like to be undone for ever: there is no work in this kind in the grave; there is no repenting in the grave, no beleeving in the grave; there is no turning to God in the grave: Oh that the Lord would perſwade your hearts of a neceſſity of ſeeking after Chriſt, and getting an intereſt in him; and do it I beſeech you ſpeedily, and diligently; the Lord hath put it into your hand, and therefore now ſeek after an intereſt in Chriſt with all your might.</p>
            <p>To you that have an intereſt in Chriſt, I ſhall ſay no more, but what I ſaid before: I laid you your work before you, get more acquaintance with God; get your hearts eſtabliſhed upon the truth of the promiſes, that you may not be left at uncertainties; and lift up God in your gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; and get your hearts made ſenſible of your frailty, to dye daily, to wait upon God with all your might in Ordinances; to get your hearts ſubdued, and your corruptions mortified: This is your work; and Oh that the Lord would help you to do it with all your might.</p>
            <p>To you that are the Fathers of the City:</p>
            <p>I have one word to you from the Father of
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:57453:115"/> Heaven: Oh that the Lord would make you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to receive it, and to do it with all your might: There is ſomething that is your work, that the Lord requires you ſhould do with all your might: I ſhall but briefly give you a few hints, and ſhal leave it to the bleſſing of the Lord.</p>
            <p>Firſt of all, There is a work of <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> that the Lord hath put into your hands: I ſay, the firſt work that God hath put into your hands, it is a work of Juſtice, to puniſh ſin; to puniſh ſin is the work that is in your hand to do, to pu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>iſh the breaches of the moral Law, and the contempts thereof: that Law of nature which is written in the heart of all men, the Lord hath put it into your hand to puniſh the breach of this Law: What ever your hand finds to do in this caſe, I beſeech you do it faithfully, do it with your might: God requires it of you, that you ſhould do it with your might; yea let your hand find out ſinners, let your hand do this work of the Lord, to puniſh the drunkards, and the ſwearers, and the prophane perſons, the decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the lyar, and the ſtealer, and all other wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of iniquity: here is no fear of ſmiting Chriſt; ſmite here and ſpare not; where there is no dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſmiting Chriſt, ſmite on and ſpare not, do it with all your might; the Lord lays it before you as your duty.</p>
            <p>Secondly, There is a work of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Equity,</hi> that the Lord puts into your hands to do: and Oh that you would do this alſo with all your might: to judge betwixt man and man; do it faithfully, to accept no mans perſon, to know
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:57453:116"/> no friend in the matter of Juſtice, but to decide every mans cauſe with wiſedom, and with faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe, and with ſincerity; not to know Father, nor Brother, nor Son, nor Daughter, as <hi>Levi</hi> did not in the cauſe of God: That ſo Juſtice and Righteouſneſs may run down as a mighty ſtream: That there may be no oppreſſion, that there may be no complaining in our ſtreets; This is the ſecond work that the Lord puts into your hand: And Oh that you would do it with your might.</p>
            <p>The third work is a work of <hi>Mercy;</hi> There is a work of mercy; the Lord puts into your hands to relieve the poor, and the needy, and the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therleſs, to take care that the poor be provided for, that they may have work, that they may have employment, and that they may have main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance; this is a work of mercy, that the Lord puts into your hands to do: Oh it is one of the crying ſins of <hi>England;</hi> it is the ſin of the whole Land; and Oh that it were not the ſin of this City, that the poor are not yet imployed and provided for; that God would put it into your hearts to do it: Oh that ſome bleſſed hand might find out this way to employ the poor; this would be an acceptable work of mercy: Know that the Lord hath given you ſomething for the poor, though I think every man hath a propriety in his eſtate, yet I alſo think that God hath given every man ſomething for the poor: and truly before God, the poor hath a right in it, though not to take, yet it is your duty to give, and to provide for them: And I fear if this work do not go through the whole land, that there be not
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:57453:116"/> ſome proviſion made for the work of the poor, and for the relief of the poor; That God will le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel this Land, and that God will bring down all the pomp and pride, and ſtain the glory of all fleſh in it; this is a work of mercy.</p>
            <p>There is a fourth work; and that is a work of <hi>Piety</hi> that God puts into your hand, to ſeek the good of poor ſouls; to provide that all that are under your power in this City, may be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the knowledg of the Lord Jeſus, to ſend in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the dark corners, (the Suburbs of this City, and not only to confine men to the heart of the City) but ſend to them that will not come out for it: <hi>The Lord Jeſus came to ſeek as well as to ſave;</hi> and therefore ſend forth to ſeek them; they know not what they do in rejecting the means of life: But Oh ſend to ſeek them, and inſtruct them in the knowledge of the Lord, that they may not periſh for want of proviſion: And what though (my Fathers and Brethren) every man cannot ſee his way clear to take a Paſtoral charge of ſuch a people, where he knows there is but little of Chriſt, yet if he do the work, what though he do it not under that notion: If he preach Chriſt to them, if he bleed for them; If his deſires be to inſtruct them, and be willing to inſtruct them in publique and private, and to pray for them, that the Lord would give them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and bring them into the number of Chriſts Sheep-fold: I ſay, if this work be done, what though it be not done under that notion? why ſhould the work of the Goſpel be hindred? If in all other things men be conſcientious, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:57453:117"/> able, and fit to teach and inſtruct the people in the knowledg of Jeſus Chriſt, this will be a work of Piety,, to ſend into the dark corners of the City, that there may be no place in which the word of the Lord ſhall not be heard.</p>
            <p>There is a work of <hi>Love to Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to your ſelves,</hi> and I will name no more; I commend this to you, as the laſt; And Oh that your hand would finde to do it, a work of love to Chriſt, and of wiſedom to your ſelves; And that is to <hi>protect the Saints,</hi> and thoſe that have an intereſt in Chriſt, and deſire to walk unblama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly before you, if they be ſuch as walk according to the Law of God, and not diſobey the Law of Magiſtracy, it is the work of the Magiſtrates to protect them: The Magiſtrate is ſet up to be a praiſe to them that do well; What though they may differ from you in particular opinions?

               </gap>rſwaded it will not excuſe before Chriſt, not to have protected them: If you be convinced that they are ſuch as fear the Lord, and deſire to walk conſcientiouſly, It is your work to be a wall to them, and to protect them, ſo they walk regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, and in the fear of the Lord: The people of God, they are the ſtrength of the Land, who ever they be, they are the ſtrength of the Land, they are the ſtrength of a City; They protect you, and therefore it is your work to protect them. The godly in a City, they protect the City, they are the ſafety of the City; God ſaid he could not deſtroy <hi>Sodom,</hi> ſo long as <hi>Lot</hi> was there, and could do nothing ſo long as righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was among them; they are the ſtrength of a

            <p>And now let me ſay to all Chriſtians, and Chriſtian Magiſtrates; Let me ſay to you all, what ever is your work, what ever is in your hand to do: Oh that the Lord would help you to do it with all your might: What is in your hand to do as Chriſtians, as Magiſtrates; Oh that the Lord would help you to do it with all your might!
